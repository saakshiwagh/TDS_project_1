A student might see this in a coding class, particularly one involving APIs or data transmission. The error message states that the \"user message\" within a `payload` (likely a data structure used to send information) is incorrect. The correct message should be `2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS`, but the system received something different, even though it appears to be the same. This suggests a problem with how the message is being constructed or handled before being sent or received. It's a very specific error, and the solution would involve careful checking of the code responsible for creating and sending this `payload`. The identical strings suggest that a bug in data handling is at play rather than a simple data mismatch.

The letter \"G\" is highlighted in a different color, suggesting this user might have a special role or status within the group.

The error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, specifically stating that the `scipy` module cannot be found. This means the program is trying to use a library (scipy, which is a scientific computing library in Python) that isn't currently installed within the Pyodide environment the code is running in. The error message helpfully provides two solutions: 1. **Using micropip (in Python):** `await micropip.install(\"scipy\")` This line of code would install the `scipy` library directly within the Pyodide environment. 2. **Using pyodide.loadPackage (in JavaScript):** `await pyodide.loadPackage(\"scipy\")`. This is an alternative way to install `scipy` if the code is being run from a Javascript environment that uses Pyodide. The message also points to online documentation for further help with installing packages in Pyodide. In short, a student needs to use one of the suggested methods to install the `scipy` module before their Python code can run correctly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/53", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment asks students to construct a JSON body for a request to OpenAI's `chat/completions` endpoint. The task simulates a real-world scenario: RapidRoute Solutions needs to generate fake but realistic US addresses in a structured JSON format for testing purposes. The student must understand how to format the request to the OpenAI API using the `gpt-40-mini` model, specify system and user messages, leverage structured outputs, and prevent additional properties in the response. Critically, students are *not* required to actually execute the API call; the focus is solely on correctly crafting the JSON request body. The absence of an answer box adds a layer of complexity, requiring students to understand how to format their answer effectively. The overall goal is to test the students' understanding of JSON formatting, API interaction, and the use of LLMs for data generation.

The task is to write a function `most_similar(embeddings)` that takes a list of word embeddings as input. The function should calculate the cosine similarity between all pairs of embeddings and return the pair with the highest similarity as a tuple. The student's code is incomplete and contains an error. They've imported the `numpy` library, which is likely needed for array operations related to cosine similarity calculations. The function definition is present, but the crucial part (the code to calculate cosine similarity and identify the most similar pair) is missing. The error message indicates a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined`. This means the student is trying to use the variables `phrase1` and `phrase2` in their `return` statement without defining them earlier in the function. They need to calculate these values (the actual phrases corresponding to the most similar embeddings) within the function's body before returning them. In short, the student needs to complete the `most_similar` function by: 1. **Calculating cosine similarity:** Use `numpy` to efficiently calculate the cosine similarity between all pairs of embeddings. 2. **Finding the maximum similarity:** Determine which pair of embeddings has the highest cosine similarity score. 3. **Retrieving the corresponding phrases:** Assuming the `embeddings` input is associated with a list of phrases, retrieve the phrases corresponding to the embeddings with the highest similarity. 4. **Returning the result:** Return the pair of phrases as a tuple.

A student is tasked with writing a function called `most_similar` that takes a list of word embeddings as input. The function should compute the cosine similarity between all pairs of embeddings and return the pair with the highest similarity as a tuple. The student's attempt is shown in the code block. The `import numpy` line suggests they intend to use NumPy for numerical calculations (likely for cosine similarity). However, their attempt is incomplete and leads to an error. The error message indicates a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined`. This means the student's function tries to use variables `phrase1` and `phrase2` without defining them. These variables would presumably store the actual phrases corresponding to the most similar embeddings. The student needs to add code to calculate the cosine similarities, find the maximum, and then use the index of the maximum similarity to retrieve the corresponding phrases from the input `embeddings`. The \"Incorrect answer\" message confirms the code is not yet functional.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/83", "type": "discourse_post"}

In a student context, this could represent several things depending on the course: * **Data Structures:** It's an example of a dictionary, a key-value store. The key `'matches'` maps to a list containing three strings: 'banana', 'watermelon', and 'jamaica'. This could be used to illustrate how dictionaries are declared and accessed in Python. * **Data Processing/Analysis:** The data could represent the results of a search or a matching algorithm. For instance, the dictionary might store the names of fruits that match a certain criteria. Students could be tasked with writing code to manipulate or analyze this data. * **JSON Data:** The structure is similar to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object, a common format for data exchange. Students learning about APIs or web development might encounter this type of data representation. * **String Manipulation:** The list of strings could be used as input for exercises on string manipulation, such as finding the longest string or counting the characters in each string. The context in which this image is shown is crucial to its interpretation for students.

The instructions ask the student to: 1. **Enable CORS:** The student needs to configure their server to handle CORS requests, specifically allowing the `OPTIONS` and `POST` HTTP methods, and potentially enabling access from all origins. This is a crucial step for web applications making requests to servers on different domains. 2. **Identify the API endpoint:** The student needs to provide the correct URL endpoint for their API. The example provided is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. This suggests the API is running locally (on the same machine, `127.0.0.1` being the loopback address) on port 8000, and the specific endpoint is `/similarity`. 3. **Correct any errors:** The \"Error: Expected 3 matches\" message indicates the student's implementation is not producing the expected number of results (presumably related to the API call or data processing). The student needs to debug their code to fix this issue. In essence, the image captures a common scenario in web development learning where students need to handle both back-end (CORS configuration) and front-end (API calls) aspects of a project. The error message highlights that a crucial element of the program—likely related to the number of matches found by the similarity API—is not working correctly.

Additionally, the instructions mention the need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow communication between the client-side application and the server-side API, likely for a web application project. The student needs to troubleshoot why their code isn't producing the expected results, likely involving a problem with their API setup or network configuration.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/85", "type": "discourse_post"}

The question is about estimating the cost of using a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT-40-Mini. The student is presented with a scenario: LexiSolve, a company using OpenAI's models, needs to accurately predict token usage to manage costs. The exam asks the student to determine the number of tokens used by a specific user message when processed by the LLM. The student must input only the valid English words from a given set and then calculate the total number of tokens the prompt consumes. The system provides a diagnostic tool to help with the calculation, but the student must manually input the answer. The exam also highlights that specifying the message as a \"user message\" adds to the total token count. The student's current score is 0/9.5, indicating they haven't answered this question correctly yet.

The student is tasked with understanding and testing the tokenization process of OpenAI's GPT-40-Mini language model. The question explains that a company, LexiSolve, uses OpenAI's language models and is charged based on the number of \"tokens\" processed. Tokens represent units of text. Because of this pricing model, LexiSolve has built a tool to measure token usage. The student's task is to use a specific user message (partially obscured in the image but visible as `list only the valid English words from these: ...`) and determine how many tokens the message consumes when sent to the GPT-40-Mini API. The student needs to submit the total number of tokens as their answer. The question emphasizes that the fact the message is identified as a *user* message adds to the token count. The student must actually make an API request to get the correct answer.

The assignment requires the student to: 1. **Understand API endpoints:** The student needs to determine the correct URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`) to interact with the API. They've entered this URL, but received a `SyntaxError` indicating a problem with their JSON formatting. 2. **Use GET requests:** The assignment involves making GET requests to the API, specifically to retrieve the status of a ticket (ticket ID 83742). The example uses `curl` (a command-line tool) to demonstrate how to make this request, showing the use of query parameters (`?q=...`). 3. **Handle JSON responses:** The API likely returns data in JSON format, and the student will need to parse and process this response to extract the ticket status. The `SyntaxError` suggests the student has an issue with their JSON handling. 4. **Understand CORS:** The instructions mention CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), a security mechanism that needs to be correctly configured to allow the student's application to make requests to the API. 5. **Format Arguments:** There's a note about ensuring that the arguments provided to the API are in the same order as defined in the function. This points to a potential issue in argument formatting if the `SyntaxError` is not solely a JSON formatting problem. In summary, the screenshot depicts a common challenge faced by students learning about APIs: properly constructing requests, handling responses, and understanding the underlying security and formatting constraints. The `SyntaxError` highlights a current problem the student is actively trying to resolve.

The assignment involves: * **API Interaction:** The student needs to send requests to an API (likely OpenAI's API) using a specific LLM model (\"gpt-40-mini\"). The code uses the `httpx` library for making HTTP requests. * **Sentiment Analysis:** The goal is to analyze the sentiment of a given text (\"N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk,\") and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. * **Message Formatting:** The student must structure their API requests correctly, using a system message to instruct the LLM and a user message containing the text to be analyzed. The current code has an error because of a small difference in capitalization. * **Testing and Validation:** The assignment emphasizes the importance of testing the API integration and message formatting to ensure reliable sentiment analysis in real-world scenarios. * **Error Handling:** The student is receiving an error message indicating that a small case error in the text is causing their code to fail. The student will need to correct this error to successfully complete the assignment. In short, this is an assessment focusing on practical application of LLMs, API usage, and error handling in a data science context. The student's score (8.5/9.5) suggests near-completion but indicates a need to fix the identified error.

The goal is to build a system that analyzes the sentiment of text and classifies it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. The assignment has several requirements: * **API Key:** The student must use a dummy API key for authentication. * **Model Selection:** The `gpt-40-mini` model must be specified. * **System Message:** The first message sent to the LLM must be a system instruction to analyze sentiment using the specified categories (GOOD, BAD, NEUTRAL). * **User Message:** The second message is the text to be analyzed. The student made a mistake in this input, resulting in an error. * **Code:** The student is writing code using a dummy `httpx` library to interact with the LLM API. The provided code snippet shows how to make GET and POST requests, handle errors, and extract JSON responses. The error message indicates a case sensitivity issue in the \"user message\" text. The student needs to correct the capitalization to match the expected input precisely. The assignment also tracks the LLM token cost, reflecting the cost of using the API. The overall task evaluates the student's ability to integrate with an LLM API, handle requests and responses, and correctly format input for sentiment analysis.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/110", "type": "discourse_post"}

The discernible text fragments suggest a message relating to a software product update. Specifically, it mentions: * **Bug fixes:** The update addresses reported bugs. * **Enhancements:** The update includes several enhancements. * **Leadership approval:** A leadership team has approved a larger-scale deployment, possibly expanding the global IT support network. The incomplete and blurry nature of the text makes a complete understanding impossible without further context or a clearer image. In a student context, this could be used as an example of: * **Data quality issues:** The blurry text highlights the challenges of working with imperfect or low-quality data. * **The importance of clear communication:** The incomplete text emphasizes the need for clear and concise documentation. * **Software development lifecycle:** The references to bugs, updates, and approvals provide a glimpse into the software development and deployment process. * **Error handling and logging:** The text fragment might come from a log file, showing the importance of tracking such data for debugging. The image serves as a visual representation of how data integrity and clarity are critical in any technical field.

In a student context, this would likely appear in a computer science or web development class. The message `\"detail\":\"Method Not Allowed\"` indicates that the HTTP request method used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) was not allowed for the requested resource on a web server. For example, trying to use a POST request on a resource that only accepts GET requests would result in this error. Students would learn about HTTP methods and how servers respond to them in subjects like web programming, networking, or API design. The JSON format is used widely to exchange data between client and server applications, and seeing this in the context of an error highlights how error messages are also structured.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/112", "type": "discourse_post"}

image 1677×303 30.6 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/d/3dbd98abc92c7dcf888d90678c083e2459abe37c_2_690x124.png [Caption] This image shows a Python code snippet aimed at finding the most similar sentence to a given sentence (\"I experienced issues during checkout.\") based on their vector embeddings. **The Code:** The code iterates through a list of sentences (`words`). For each sentence, it calculates the dot product between its embedding vector (`embeddings[j]`) and the embedding vector of the target sentence (`embeddings[i]`). These dot products are stored in `dot_product_df`. Finally, it finds the maximum dot product, indicating the sentence with the highest similarity to the target sentence. The result is then printed. **The Error:** The error message \"TypeError: Z.runPython(..).tols is not a function\" at the bottom indicates a problem outside of the snippet shown. This error likely stems from how the code interacts with a larger program or library (possibly named \"Z\"). The `tols` part suggests a potential issue with a variable or function name within that external program. The provided code itself is syntactically correct (except potentially for `dot_product_df` which needs proper initialization before appending). **Student Context:** This would be relevant in a computer science or data science course covering topics like: * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The core concept is finding semantic similarity using vector representations (embeddings) of sentences. * **Python Programming:** The code uses fundamental Python constructs like loops (`for`), lists, and functions. The use of `numpy`'s `dot` function indicates familiarity with numerical computation libraries. * **Error Handling and Debugging:** The error message highlights the importance of debugging and understanding error messages in a programming context. The student needs to investigate the cause of the error beyond the provided snippet. In summary, this image captures a common task in NLP – finding similar sentences. However, the error message indicates that the student needs to resolve an issue outside the direct code segment shown. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/d/3dbd98abc92c7dcf888d90678c083e2459abe37c.png [Caption] This image shows a student's attempt at writing Python code. The goal appears to be to find the sentence in a dataset (`embeddings`) that is most similar to the sentence \"I experienced issues during checkout.\" The code uses a dot product to calculate similarity between word embeddings. The code has a few issues: * **`dot_product_df.append(...)`:** This line suggests the student is trying to append dot products to a Pandas DataFrame called `dot_product_df`. However, the exact nature of `dot_product_df` and how it's initialized is not shown in the image. It's likely improperly defined or not correctly initialized before the loop. * **`return max(dot product_df)`:** This attempts to return the maximum dot product, implying that higher dot products indicate greater similarity. * **`print(most_similar(...))`:** This line uses a function `most_similar` which is not defined in the shown code. It seems to expect a list of dot products as input. * **`TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function`:** This error message is crucial. It indicates that the code is likely being executed within a JavaScript environment (perhaps a Jupyter Notebook or similar interactive environment) that's trying to interact with a Python kernel. The error points towards a problem with the bridge between the JavaScript and Python environments. The student's code might be correctly written in Python, but the way it's being executed (through `Z.runPython`) is causing a failure. In short, the code attempts to perform a similarity search using dot products of word embeddings, but it contains errors in variable handling and potentially in the execution environment. The `TypeError` is the most serious issue and prevents the code from running successfully. The student needs to resolve this environment-specific error and correctly initialize and use the `dot_product_df` variable.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/115", "type": "discourse_post"}

The screenshot displays two main sections: **1. Web Browser (left):** This shows a web page likely part of an online assignment platform. The student has been tasked with making API calls to a similarity endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`). The instructions explain that they need to send POST requests with a JSON body containing a `docs` array (list of documents) and a `query` string. The page provides example code and error messages regarding incorrect matches. The student's current score is 7/9.5, indicating they are close to completing the task. A \"Check\" button implies an automated grading system. **2. API Testing Tool and Terminal (right):** This section shows the student using an API testing tool (likely Thunder Client, a VS Code extension) to make the POST request described in the browser window. The request includes the JSON payload as specified in the instructions, containing sample document contents and a query string. The tool successfully returned a 200 OK status code, meaning the request was processed correctly. The successful response shows the matching documents (\"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\", \"Contents of document 3\"). The terminal window reveals that the student is running a local server (`uvicorn`), which is presumably hosting the API the student is interacting with. The terminal output confirms that the server received and handled POST requests successfully. In summary, the image captures a student actively debugging and testing their solution for an API interaction task, using both a web browser interface for instructions and an API client for testing their implementation. The terminal output shows the backend process running and logging the API calls. The overall context suggests a coursework involving REST APIs, JSON data handling, and possibly microservices architecture.

The left side displays the assignment instructions, which include a task to identify the correct API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`) and send a POST request with a JSON body containing a query and documents. The student has already attempted the task, receiving an error message indicating incorrect matches. The error message provides context, stating the system is undergoing maintenance and suggests checking the IT support portal. The student has also correctly identified the order of the closest matches. The right side shows the student using a tool like Thunder Client (a REST client) to test the API. The student has successfully sent a POST request to the specified endpoint with a JSON payload containing sample documents and a query string. The API response confirms a 200 OK status and returns a JSON array of matching documents, which is different from what is expected in the assignment.

This error indicates that the data being sent to the API is not properly formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common data format for APIs. The student needs to fix the data being sent to the API, not the endpoint URL itself.

The question asks for the API URL endpoint, which is the address used to communicate with a web service. The student provides an answer (`http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute`), but the system indicates an error: \"SyntaxError: \"[object Object]\" is not valid JSON.\" This means that the data the API received from the student's code was not formatted correctly as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a standard data-interchange format. The example URL provided in the question, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`, likely serves as a guide or hint. The different port numbers (8000 vs 9000) suggests a potential issue with the student's setup or code.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/120", "type": "discourse_post"}

Specifically, it demonstrates a text input field within the OpenAI API interface. A student could interpret this as follows: * **The Model Selection:** The top shows options to choose which OpenAI language model to use (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, or the legacy GPT-3). This highlights the different capabilities and strengths of various AI models. * **The Input Text:** The central box contains a long string of seemingly random alphanumeric characters. This could be an example of a prompt, though it's nonsensical and probably not intended for meaningful interpretation. The point is to show the input format expected by the API and the character limit. * **Token and Character Counts:** Below the input box, the interface displays the number of tokens (406) and characters (625) in the provided input. This is crucial information because these metrics affect the cost and processing time of using the API. Tokens represent meaningful units of text (words, punctuation), not just characters. This shows students how the API processes text internally and highlights limitations on input length. * **Buttons:** The \"Clear\" and \"Show example\" buttons demonstrate the basic interaction with the API. In summary, the image provides a visual representation of a crucial aspect of interacting with the OpenAI API: inputting text and understanding tokenization and character limits, essential for anyone using the API for projects involving natural language processing.

The error message indicates the API returned incorrect data, possibly due to issues related to employee cybersecurity training, updated staff handbooks, and the implementation of automated testing protocols. This suggests a problem with the API's data or its interaction with other systems. The error message highlights the need for further debugging and troubleshooting to resolve the incorrect matches being returned by the API.

In a student context, this could represent several things: * **Database Management:** The lines indicate the successful creation and population of a database collection (\"documents\"). This demonstrates practical skills in database interaction (using a query language, likely something like MongoDB or similar). Students might be learning about database design, data manipulation, or API interaction. * **Information Retrieval:** The query itself (\"How is our internal training addressing cybersecurity challenges?\") and the resulting matches show an example of information retrieval. This is relevant to courses in computer science, information science, or even business analytics, illustrating how to search and extract relevant information from a structured data source. * **Cybersecurity:** The content of the query and the results highlight a real-world application in cybersecurity. This could be used in a cybersecurity course to illustrate how organizations document and track their cybersecurity training programs and initiatives. It shows the importance of data-driven approaches to security awareness. * **API Interaction:** The lines `INFO: 127.0.0.1:59423 \"OPTIONS /similarity HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK` and `INFO: 127.0.0.1:59423 \"POST /similarity HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK` suggest interaction with an API (Application Programming Interface). This would be important for students learning web development, software engineering, or data science where interacting with APIs is a common task.

The request is using JSON format in the body, and the response shows a successful 200 OK status code, indicating that the server processed the request successfully. The JSON response includes a list of strings under the key `\"matches\"`. The student has selected \"No Auth\" meaning no authentication is required to access this API. This is likely part of a computer science or software engineering course focusing on APIs, backend development, or testing. The content of the `matches` array suggests the API might be related to semantic search or text similarity.

Specifically: * **The API call:** The student is making a POST request to the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. This suggests they are testing an API that likely performs some kind of similarity analysis. The `127.0.0.1` address indicates it's a local API running on their machine. * **The request body:** The request body contains a JSON payload with a key \"matches\" containing three strings, likely sample text for the similarity analysis. * **No Authorization:** The API doesn't require any authentication or authorization tokens. * **Successful response:** The API returned a 200 OK status code, meaning the request was successful.

The response data suggests that the server responded with the same data sent in the request. In a student context, this could be part of a project involving: * **API development:** The student might be building the API themselves and testing its functionality. * **API testing:** The student might be testing an existing API as part of a coursework assignment or a personal project. * **Machine learning:** Given the content of the request body (\"Embedding models improve NLP,\" etc.), the student could be working on a machine learning project involving natural language processing (NLP) or a similar application.

The instructions highlight several key features: * **Open-book nature:** Students are encouraged to use any resources, including the internet, ChatGPT, and collaboration with others. Even hacking the code is permitted. * **Frequent saving and checking:** Students should regularly save their progress (the last saved submission is the one graded) and check their answers to see which are correct. * **Multiple servers:** The exam utilizes multiple servers running simultaneously, potentially to mitigate cheating attempts. * **Flexibility:** Students can skip questions or explore the provided material at their discretion. * **Technical troubleshooting:** Advice is given on handling potential browser issues. In short, this exam appears to be designed to test understanding and problem-solving abilities in a context that encourages resourcefulness and self-directed learning rather than rote memorization. The unconventional approach, particularly the allowance of code hacking, suggests a focus on practical application and deeper comprehension of the subject matter.

The exam allows students to: * **Learn the material:** Reading material is provided, but students can skip it if they know the answers. * **Check answers frequently:** The \"Check\" button provides immediate feedback on whether answers are correct or incorrect, and this can be done multiple times. * **Save frequently:** The \"Save\" button saves answers; only the last saved submission will be graded. Saving is done client-side (in the browser), not on the server. * **Use any resources:** Students are permitted to use the internet, ChatGPT, or any other resources they choose, along with external libraries and frameworks. They can even try to \"hack\" the code. * **Understand the server setup:** The exam uses multiple servers that must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers. Browser issues might arise due to this. The instructions emphasize a flexible and open approach to the exam, prioritizing understanding and problem-solving over memorization. The student's last saved answers are the ones that will be graded.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/141", "type": "discourse_post"}

None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine. I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.

The task is to build a simple question-answering API using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The API should accept GET requests containing a question, and return a JSON response with the answer and relevant source text excerpts from the TypeScript Book. The exercise provides: * **Expected Output:** The API should return both raw matching text snippets and a concise summary answer. * **Example Questions and Answers:** Two sample questions and their expected answers are given for testing. * **Task Requirements:** Four specific requirements outline the API's functionality, including the JSON response format, handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and the URL to test. * **Testing:** The student is instructed to enter the URL of their running API endpoint for automated testing. The system will send questions and check the responses against the expected answers.

Several key features are highlighted: * **Open-ended nature:** The instructions explicitly state the student can use any resources (internet, AI tools, friends, etc.) and that even hacking the code is permitted to find answers. This suggests a unique and unconventional assessment designed to test problem-solving skills beyond rote memorization. * **Technical challenge:** The exam acknowledges potential browser loading issues, prompting students to try different browsers or disable security restrictions. The mention of running multiple servers simultaneously during the exam indicates a complex system underlying the assessment. * **Collaboration and support:** A link to a Discourse forum is provided for students to ask questions and discuss the exam. * **Saving mechanism:** The \"Recent saves\" section shows that the student had saved their progress multiple times prior to the exam's conclusion. * **Student ID:** The student is identified by their unique login ID (23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in).

The exam allows students to: * **Check their answers multiple times:** The system provides immediate feedback on the correctness of answers. * **Save their work frequently:** Answers are saved in the browser, allowing for multiple saves and reloading without losing progress. * **Use any resources:** The exam explicitly permits the use of external resources, such as the internet, ChatGPT, or other tools. It even encourages \"hacking\" the code as a permitted method to find answers. * **Run multiple servers:** A unique aspect is the requirement to run multiple servers concurrently while working on the exam. This is likely part of the exam's design or a security measure. The interface displays the student's current score (0), a countdown timer (ended), and their recent save attempts with their corresponding scores. There's also a link to a discussion forum for questions. The student's login information is visible. The permissive nature of resource use suggests this is likely an exam focused on testing problem-solving skills rather than rote memorization.

The exam has ended at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, February 5th, 2025. The student's current score is 0. Key features of the exam include: * **Frequent Checking and Saving:** Students are encouraged to check their answers and save their progress frequently. The system will use the student's last saved answers for grading. Reloading the page is allowed. * **Open Resource Policy:** The exam allows students to use any resources they want, including the internet, AI chatbots (like ChatGPT), and any programming libraries or frameworks. * **Allowed Hacking:** The exam explicitly permits students to attempt to find answers by directly examining or modifying the exam's code. * **Multiple Servers:** The exam runs on multiple servers, which must all be running simultaneously for checking and saving to function correctly. * **Discourse Forum:** A link to a Discourse forum is provided for students to ask questions. The student is logged in using their university email address, which indicates this is likely a university-administered exam. The \"Recent saves\" section shows the student's scores from previous saves.

The student is asked to demonstrate understanding of file manipulation in a Linux/Unix environment using command-line tools. The problem has two parts: 1. **File Organization and Renaming:** The student needs to download a zip file containing several files spread across subdirectories. They must then use the `mv` command to consolidate all these files into a single, empty directory. Afterward, they must rename each file, incrementing every digit within the filename. For example, a file named \"a19b.txt\" becomes \"a20b.txt\". 2. **Command-Line Analysis:** The student must then execute a specific bash command sequence within the directory containing the renamed files: `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`. They are asked to describe the output of this command sequence. This tests understanding of the following commands: * `grep .*`: This searches for all files (`.`) and displays their names. The `.*` is a regular expression that matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`). * `LC_ALL=C sort`: This sorts the filenames using the C locale, ensuring consistent sorting regardless of the system's language settings. * `sha256sum`: This calculates the SHA-256 hash of the sorted filenames. The output would be a list of hashes, one for each filename. In essence, the question assesses the student's practical knowledge of file system manipulation, command-line tools (including regular expressions), and the ability to interpret and predict the outcome of a complex command pipeline in a Linux/Unix environment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/3", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment focuses on CSS selectors, a fundamental concept in web development. The assignment has several parts: 1. **Understanding CSS Selectors:** The student is instructed to use the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation to learn about the three main types of CSS selectors: basic selectors (element, class, ID, universal), attribute selectors, and combinators. 2. **Interactive Practice:** The student is encouraged to practice their CSS selector skills using an interactive tool called \"CSS Diner,\" which is described as a fun game that teaches CSS selectors through increasingly challenging levels. 3. **Assessment Question:** The main part of the assignment involves a problem-solving task. The student is asked to find all ` ` elements with the class \"foo\" within a hidden HTML element and then calculate the sum of their `data-value` attributes. The student's current answer (482) is marked as incorrect. 4. **Other Tasks:** The assignment also includes another task (item 12) that deals with processing files with different encodings.

Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.

The problem asks the student to calculate the number of Wednesdays between August 9th, 1986, and June 19th, 2012, inclusive. The student initially provided an incorrect answer (1349). The prompt clarifies the date format and requests the inclusion of both start and end dates. The main part of the image displays a Python code solution. The code uses the `datetime` module to define the start and end dates, then iterates through the date range, counting only the Wednesdays. The `weekday()` method (where Monday is 0 and Tuesday is 1 etc) is used to check for Wednesdays. The code efficiently jumps seven days at a time after finding the first Wednesday to speed up the process. The terminal output at the bottom confirms that the code correctly calculates 1349 Wednesdays. The final answer box shows the correct output, indicating the student successfully solved the problem after implementing the code. The code is well-commented, making it easy to understand the logic used.

The problem is to determine how many Wednesdays fall within a specific date range (August 9, 1986 to June 19, 2012). The top section presents the problem statement in a testing or assignment interface. The student has initially entered an incorrect answer. The middle section displays Python code designed to solve the problem. The code uses the `datetime` library to handle dates. It iterates through the specified date range, incrementing by 7 days at a time (to only consider Wednesdays) and counts the number of Wednesdays encountered. The bottom section shows the correct answer, output by the student's code: 1349 Wednesdays. The output clarifies that the calculation includes both the start and end dates of the range (August 8th, 1986, and June 19th, 2012, respectively). This demonstrates the successful execution of the Python code. In short, the image documents the process of solving a date-related programming task.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/34", "type": "discourse_post"}

I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong. Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post 1080×1080 126 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/f/cfbf846fed1d092f2fe49741a8bc37821a01c952.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student working on a programming assignment involving character encoding and data processing. The main components are: 1. **Python Code:** The largest portion shows Python code designed to read three files (two CSV and one TXT) with varying encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16). The code detects the encoding of each file, reads the data, and then processes the data to calculate a sum of values associated with specific symbols (`€`, `#`, and variations of the euro symbol). The code handles potential errors like files not being found or decoding issues. It shows clear comments explaining each step of the code. 2. **Code Output:** At the very bottom, the code's output is shown. It displays the final calculated sum (31512.0). It also prompts the user to enter the file paths, implying this is an interactive script. 3. **Video Reference (likely):** A screenshot of a YouTube video (likely from the \"Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You\" series) is present. The video title suggests it covers topics directly related to the programming task: character encodings, Unicode, UTF-8, and BOM (Byte Order Mark). The video's content is strongly relevant to the context of the assignment. A description underneath indicates a `.zip` file containing the data files used in the assignment. In summary, the image provides a complete view of a student's work, including the code, the related video providing background information, and the final output, demonstrating their understanding of file handling, character encoding, and data manipulation in Python. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/f/cfbf846fed1d092f2fe49741a8bc37821a01c952_2_500x500.jpeg [Caption] Here's a description of the image suitable for a student context: The image shows a student's computer screen split into three main sections. The largest section displays Python code in a dark-themed code editor. The code appears to be designed to read data from multiple files (CSV and TXT), handle different character encodings, process the data, and calculate a sum based on specific criteria (matching symbols and their associated values). The comments in the code clearly explain each step of the process, suggesting a focus on understanding and maintainability. The code includes error handling for situations where files are not found or cannot be decoded. The final output shows the calculated sum, indicating successful execution. The second section shows a smaller window with instructions and potentially input data for the Python program, likely related to the specific files the code is designed to work with. The third section displays a video thumbnail from a programming tutorial (possibly on character encoding or related topics) from a channel named \"Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You\". This suggests the student is either learning or reviewing concepts related to file handling and character encoding. The image implies a self-directed learning approach; combining code practice with external educational resources. In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a student actively engaging in a programming assignment or self-study, illustrating their use of programming tools, problem-solving, and supplemental learning resources. The Python code demonstrates skills in file I/O, data processing, error handling and character encoding.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/35", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student first uses the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to compute the hash. They then use `npx` (a package runner for Node.js) to run the `prettier` code formatter on a README file, saving the output to `formatted.md`. This formatting step is likely done to improve the readability of the file before calculating the hash. The student repeats the `Get-FileHash` command after formatting to ensure the hash reflects the formatted file. Finally, as a check, they utilize the `certutil` command (a Windows command-line tool) to compute the SHA256 hash again, demonstrating the consistency of the hash across different methods. The output displays the SHA256 hash value for the `formatted.md` file, confirming that the hash is consistent across the two different commands used, which is an important verification step in many computing and security applications (like verifying file integrity). The file path indicates the student is working within their user directory (`C:\\Users\\kaiff`). The file path for the original README file also points to a data science project directory structure.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/61", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student is likely working on a command-line task. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Directory Navigation Error:** The student first attempts to navigate to a directory `C:\\Users\\HP\\downloads\\Downloads`, but receives an error because the inner `Downloads` folder doesn't exist within the `downloads` folder. This highlights a common mistake in file path management. * **Installing a Package (npm):** The command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt` shows the student using Node Package Manager (npm) to install a specific version (`3.4.2`) of the `prettier` code formatter and then running it on a file named `README.md`, saving the output to `output.txt`. This suggests a programming or web development context. Prettier is used to automatically format code, making it easier to read and maintain. * **Hash Calculation:** The `Get-FileHash` command calculates the SHA256 hash of the `output.txt` file. The resulting hash is displayed. This is a common technique used to verify file integrity – ensuring the file hasn't been tampered with. * **Understanding the Output:** The output clearly shows the algorithm used (SHA256) and the resulting hash value. The student likely needs this hash value for verification purposes, potentially comparing it to a known good hash to ensure the file downloaded or processed correctly. **In summary:** The image depicts a student using PowerShell to perform tasks related to file management, package installation, and data integrity verification. This is likely part of a larger assignment or project. The error in the first part of the image is a valuable learning point about directory structures and path accuracy.

A student is likely working on a command-line task. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Error Handling:** The first part shows an error. The student tried to change directories (`cd`) to a nested \"Downloads\" folder within their existing \"downloads\" folder, but that nested folder doesn't exist. This highlights the importance of understanding file paths and directory structures. * **Command Execution:** The student then uses `npx` (a Node.js package runner) to install and run `prettier`, a code formatter, on a file named `README.md`, redirecting the output to a file named `output.txt`. This demonstrates using command-line tools for software development tasks. * **Hash Calculation:** The `Get-FileHash` command calculates the SHA256 hash of the `output.txt` file. This is a common practice in software development and cybersecurity to verify file integrity. The resulting hash value is displayed. The student is likely learning about data integrity and verification techniques. **Overall Learning Points:** This screenshot could be used to illustrate several concepts in a computer science or software engineering class: * **Command-line interfaces (CLIs):** The student is interacting directly with the operating system through the PowerShell CLI. * **File system navigation:** The error demonstrates the importance of correct file paths and directory structures. * **Error handling and debugging:** The error message is a crucial part of troubleshooting and learning how to interpret error messages. * **Software development tools:** The use of `npx` and `prettier` illustrates the common use of external tools in software development workflows. * **Hashing and data integrity:** Calculating the SHA256 hash shows a method for verifying data integrity. The screenshot provides a practical example of how these concepts are used together in a real-world scenario.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/77", "type": "discourse_post"}

In a student context, this could be used to illustrate several concepts: * **Data Structures:** The JSON demonstrates a nested structure with `args` and `headers` objects. This is a fundamental concept in computer science used for organizing and representing data. * **Web Development:** The data shows common HTTP headers, like `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `User-Agent`. Students learning web development would recognize these as metadata sent with a request, informing the server about the client's capabilities and preferences. The `User-Agent` string specifically shows the browser and operating system information. * **Networking:** The `origin` and `url` fields illustrate the source of the request and its destination. This highlights the client-server model in networking. The `Host` header specifies the server the request is directed to. * **API Interaction:** The request is likely part of an API call to `httpbin.org`. This service is often used for testing and demonstrating APIs. The `email` field within the `args` section suggests data is being sent to the server for processing. * **Data Transmission:** The JSON payload highlights how data is packaged and transmitted across a network. This could be used to discuss data serialization and encoding. * **Security:** While not explicitly shown, the data transmitted raises concerns about security, specifically about how the email address is passed. The structure could be used as an example to discuss the importance of secure data transmission methods. For students, the image provides a real-world example of data exchange in a web environment. It's a concrete illustration of abstract concepts learned in various computer science and web development courses. The specific values (email address, IP address, User Agent) could be changed to protect privacy if used as a teaching example.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/84", "type": "discourse_post"}

The question is worth 0.5 marks and involves two parts: **Part 1:** The student is instructed to download a zip file (`q-move-rename-files.zip`), extract its contents, and then use the `mv` command to consolidate all files from any subfolders into a single, empty directory. Finally, they must rename every file by incrementing each digit (1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3, ..., 9 becomes 0). An example is given: `a1b9c.txt` becomes `a2b0c.txt`. **Part 2:** After completing the file manipulation in Part 1, the student needs to execute a specific bash command sequence: `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`. The question asks what output this command produces. The student's attempt (`f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d`) is marked as incorrect. The overall task tests the student's understanding of basic Linux commands (`mv`, `grep`, `sort`, `sha256sum`), file manipulation, and command chaining. The `LC_ALL=C` setting ensures a locale-independent sort. The `grep . *` likely finds all files in the directory (`.` matches any character, `*` matches any number of characters). The output of `sha256sum` is a cryptographic hash, implying that the question likely assesses understanding of file integrity verification. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/1/01b4483a493dface204efbc60ad43d487c00ccae_2_690x149.png [Caption] This is a computer science question testing knowledge of command-line tools in a Linux-like environment. A student is given a zip file containing files. They are instructed to: 1. **Extract the files:** Unzip the `q-move-rename-files.zip` archive. 2. **Move the files:** Use the `mv` command to consolidate all files from any subfolders into a single, empty directory. 3. **Rename the files:** Systematically rename every file. Each digit in the filename is incremented (1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3, ..., 9 becomes 0). After completing these steps, the student needs to execute a bash command: `grep -rLC_ALL -c sort | sha256sum` on the directory containing the modified files. The output of this command, specifically the SHA256 checksum, is the answer. The student's initial answer (`f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d*`) is incorrect. The question assesses the student's understanding of: * **File manipulation:** Using `mv` to move files and understanding directory structures. * **File renaming:** Performing a batch rename operation based on a specific pattern. * **Bash scripting:** Constructing and executing a command chain using `grep`, `sort`, and `sha256sum`. Specifically, this tests their understanding of `grep`'s recursive search (`-r`), `-c` count option and `LC_ALL` locale for character sorting. * **Checksums:** Knowing what a SHA256 checksum is and its purpose. The question requires practical experience with the Linux command line and file system manipulation.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/85", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student has a table named `tickets` with columns including `Units`, `Price`, and `TYPE`. The student's initial query: `SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE == 'Gold';` is incorrect, as indicated by the error message `Got [[42810.5]]`. The exact nature of the error isn't shown but it likely involves case sensitivity or handling of variations in the `TYPE` column (e.g., \"gold\", \"GOLD\"). The instructions below the error clarify the requirements: the query should: 1. **Handle case-insensitivity:** The query should include all ticket types regardless of capitalization (e.g., \"gold\", \"GOLD\"). 2. **Handle whitespace:** The query should ignore leading or trailing spaces in the `TYPE` column. 3. **Calculate total sales:** The query must multiply `Units` and `Price` for each Gold ticket and sum the results. The student needs to improve their SQL query to correctly address these points, possibly using functions like `UPPER()` or `LOWER()` for case-insensitive comparison, `TRIM()` to remove whitespace, and potentially `LIKE` for flexible pattern matching.

The task is to calculate the total sales of \"Gold\" ticket types from a `tickets` table. The student's initial query `SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE == 'Gold';` is incorrect, resulting in an error (Error: Got [[42810.5]]...). The error suggests a problem with the query's syntax or logic. The feedback at the bottom provides additional instructions: * **Case-Insensitivity:** The query should be case-insensitive and handle variations in spelling (e.g., \"GOLD\", \"gold\"). * **Data Cleaning:** Spaces in the `TYPE` column should be ignored. * **Calculation:** The sales should be calculated correctly as `Units * Price` and then summed up. The image illustrates a common problem in SQL exercises: the need to consider data quality issues (case, spaces) and implement correct calculations. The student needs to revise their query to account for these issues.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/86", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is being tested on their ability to use CSS selectors to find and manipulate elements within HTML. Specifically, the question asks the student to: 1. **Use CSS selectors:** The instructions mention using CSS selectors, which is a fundamental concept in web development for targeting specific HTML elements using their properties (like class names, IDs, etc.). 2. **Find specific ` ` elements:** The student needs to locate all ` ` elements that have a class of \"foo.\" 3. **Access and sum data attributes:** Each ` ` element has a `data-value` attribute containing a numerical value. The student must find the sum of these values from all the matching ` ` elements. 4. **Hidden element:** The ` ` elements are located within a hidden element (not shown in the screenshot), meaning the student can't visually inspect the values. They must rely entirely on their CSS selector skills and potentially JavaScript (depending on the platform). The empty input field is where the student should enter their calculated sum. The \"Incorrect. Try again.\" message indicates the student's previous attempt was wrong. The hidden HTML element, not shown here, holds the ` ` tags the student needs to use CSS selectors to target.

A SHA256 hash is a unique digital fingerprint of a file. If even a single bit of the file changes, the hash will be completely different. This is used to verify file integrity. * **The long hexadecimal string**: This is the SHA256 hash of the `README.md` file. It's a long string of numbers and letters because it represents a very large number. * **`npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`**: This command uses `npm` (a package manager for Node.js) to run the `prettier` tool (a code formatter). It formats the `README.md` file and saves the output to a new file called `output.txt`. * **`Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt`**: This PowerShell command (indicated by `Get-FileHash`) calculates the SHA256 hash of the newly formatted `output.txt` file. * **The table at the bottom**: This summarizes the results, showing the algorithm used (SHA256), the resulting hash for `output.txt`, and the file path. **In essence, the student is demonstrating a process to:** 1. Generate a SHA256 hash of a file to verify its integrity. 2. Modify the file (using `prettier`). 3. Generate a new SHA256 hash of the modified file. By comparing the two hashes, one could confirm whether any changes were made to the original file during the formatting process.

[Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/c/0c8befb5185c68f63c51334b862b93b39fb13b58.png [Caption] This image shows a terminal command being executed. Let's break it down for a student: * **`sarva@SURIYA MINGW64 ~/downloads`**: This is the user's prompt. It tells us: * **`sarva`**: The username. * **`SURIYA`**: Likely the hostname or computer name. * **`MINGW64`**: Indicates the user is working in a Windows environment using the MinGW64 compiler (a popular way to compile and run command-line tools like the one shown). * **`~/downloads`**: Shows the current working directory is the user's downloads folder. * **`$ npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`**: This is the command itself. It uses `npx`, a package runner for Node.js. Let's break it further: * **`npx`**: Executes the command that follows. * **`-y`**: This flag means \"yes\" to any prompts the command might ask. It automatically accepts default settings, typically used for automated installs. * **`prettier@3.4.2`**: Specifies the package to run (Prettier, a code formatter) and its version (3.4.2). * **`README.md`**: This is the input file. It's likely a file explaining the project. `.md` stands for Markdown, a common format for documentation. * **`|`**: This is a pipe. It takes the output of the `prettier` command and feeds it as input to the next command. * **`sha256sum`**: This command calculates the SHA256 checksum of the formatted `README.md` file. A checksum is a hash used to verify file integrity; it ensures the file hasn't been altered since it was created. * **`2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-`**: This long string of hexadecimal characters is the SHA256 checksum calculated by the `sha256sum` command. The `*-` indicates a possible error or truncation of the output (the checksum might be incomplete). In short, the student is using `npx` to run the code formatter `prettier` on their `README.md` file and then calculating the SHA256 checksum of the formatted output. This is a common practice in software development to ensure the integrity of the documentation. The incomplete output (`*-`) suggests there might be a problem, but the main idea of the command is clear.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/109", "type": "discourse_post"}

The problem involves: 1. **Downloading a zip file:** The student needs to download a file named `q-list-files-attributes.zip`. 2. **Extracting the file:** Crucially, the instructions emphasize using a proper archiving tool like `unzip` or `7-Zip` and *not* Windows Explorer to extract the contents. Using Windows Explorer will corrupt the file timestamps, which are essential for solving the problem. 3. **Using the `ls` command:** Once extracted, the student must use the Linux command `ls` (list) with appropriate options to list all files in the extracted folder. This command should display the file size and modification date for each file. 4. **Calculating the total size:** The student must then calculate the total size of all files that meet two criteria: * They are at least 2404 bytes in size. * They were last modified on or after March 18th, 2002, 1:02 AM IST (India Standard Time). The student's initial answer (485969) is incorrect, indicating a mistake in either the extraction process, the `ls` command usage, or the subsequent calculation.

A table named `tickets` contains data on concert ticket bids, with columns for `type`, `units`, and `price`. The task is to calculate the total sales for \"Gold\" tickets. The student is asked to write an SQL query to achieve this. An initial attempt is shown, using `select sum(units*price) from tickets where type='gold' collate nocase;`. However, this query results in an error (likely due to a data type mismatch or unexpected data format). The corrected instructions emphasize ignoring case differences and variations in spelling (like \"GOLD\" or \"gold\") when selecting \"Gold\" tickets, indicating the initial query's flaw. Students need to write a SQL query that correctly handles these issues and accurately calculates the total sales of gold tickets. The error message is a clue for debugging the query.

The `collate nocase` clause attempts to handle variations in capitalization (like 'gold', 'Gold', etc.). However, it resulted in an error (`Got [[124944.59]]...`), indicating a potential issue with the query or data. The subsequent instruction clarifies that the solution should also ignore spaces in the `type` column and consider different capitalizations of \"Gold\" as equivalent. The student needs to modify the query to accurately reflect these requirements and get the correct sum of sales for all \"Gold\" tickets, addressing the error in the original query. This is a common problem to illustrate case-insensitive searching and data cleaning techniques in SQL.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/115", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is asked to perform a series of steps: 1. **Download a file:** The student needs to download a text file named `q-multi-cursor-json.txt`. This file presumably contains data in a format that needs to be converted. 2. **Edit the file:** Using the concept of \"multi-cursors\" (a feature in some code editors allowing simultaneous editing at multiple points), the student should edit the downloaded file to transform it into a valid JSON object. The specific instruction is to convert key-value pairs into a standard JSON object format: `{\"key\": \"value\", \"key\": \"value\", ...}` 3. **Use a JSON Hashing Tool:** Once the file is converted, the student should paste the resulting JSON code into a tool located at `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash`. This tool calculates a hash value of the JSON data. 4. **Obtain the Hash:** The final answer is the hash value generated by the website after clicking the \"Hash\" button. The student's initial answer (`c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536`) was incorrect. The question assesses the student's understanding of JSON formatting, using code editor features like multi-cursors, and their ability to interact with an online tool. The points assigned (0.5 marks) suggests it's a relatively straightforward part of a larger assessment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/6/e60748f8290e5bf6a7fedca9e4555355e48947f6.png [Caption] This is a programming question for students, likely in a data science or computer science course. The question involves several steps: 1. **Data Acquisition:** Students need to download a text file (`q-multi-cursor-json.txt`). 2. **Data Transformation:** The file's content needs to be edited using a \"multi-cursor\" editing technique (suggesting a text editor capable of simultaneous editing at multiple points). This editing transforms key-value pairs in the file into a standard JSON object format: `{\"key\": value, \"key\": value, ...}`. The instruction implies the initial format is not JSON. 3. **Hash Calculation:** After transforming the data into a valid JSON object, students must paste this JSON into a specified online tool (`tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash`). This tool calculates a hash value (a unique fingerprint) of the JSON data. 4. **Result Submission:** Finally, the computed hash value should be entered as the answer. The student's answer (`c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536`) is marked incorrect, suggesting they made a mistake in one or more of the previous steps. In essence, the question tests the students' ability to: * Download files. * Use multi-cursor editing (implied advanced text-editing skill). * Format data into JSON. * Utilize an online tool. * Understand hash functions. The question is worth 0.5 marks, indicating it's a relatively short problem.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/118", "type": "discourse_post"}

The instructions are quite open-ended, encouraging students to: * **Learn the material at their own pace:** Reading materials are provided but skipping is allowed if they can answer the questions independently. * **Check their answers frequently:** The \"Check\" button provides immediate feedback. * **Save their work regularly:** Progress is saved in the browser, allowing multiple saves and reloads without penalty. * **Use any resources available:** The assignment explicitly allows the use of the internet, ChatGPT, friends, and any libraries or frameworks. It even states that hacking the code to find answers is acceptable. The final section suggests students consider taking the full TDS course based on their performance on this assignment: completion within 2 hours and a score above 8/10 are suggested indicators of success in the full course. The overall tone suggests a flexible and potentially challenging assessment focused on problem-solving and resourcefulness.

The instructions highlight several key points: * **Learning and Checking:** Students are encouraged to learn the material but can skip ahead if they already know the answers. They can check their answers repeatedly using a \"Check\" button to see which are correct. * **Saving:** Answers are saved in the student's browser, not on a server, and can be saved multiple times. Only the last saved submission will be graded. The system allows reloading without losing progress. * **Technical Troubleshooting:** The assignment acknowledges potential browser issues and encourages students to adjust security settings or use a different browser if needed. * **Resource Use:** Students are explicitly permitted to utilize any resources, including the internet, AI tools like ChatGPT, collaboration with friends, and even hacking the code to find answers. This suggests a focus on learning and problem-solving, rather than strict adherence to individual work. * **Assessment Advice:** The instructions conclude by providing guidance on how the assignment's completion time and score might indicate the student's likely performance in the course. A quick completion time and a high score suggest success. In short, the assignment appears to be a flexible, open-ended quiz or assessment designed to test understanding rather than rote memorization, encouraging students to explore and use available resources.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga1-development-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161083/124", "type": "discourse_post"}

The checks involved verifying aspects of their GitHub repository and Docker image. Specifically, the student's Docker image was found to be present and public in Docker Hub, but the following were missing or incorrect: * **Public GitHub Repository:** Their GitHub repository was not public. * **Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` was missing from the root directory of their GitHub repository. * **MIT License:** A LICENSE file with the MIT license was not present in their GitHub repository. The email directs the student to the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page for more detailed information on the requirements. Essentially, the student needs to fix these issues in their repository before their project submission will be considered.

The email explains that the student's submission has been evaluated, and provides links to various log files detailing the performance and functionality of their Docker image. These include logs of the evaluation process itself, the Docker container's activity, and server startup. Crucially, the email highlights missing files which resulted in a score of zero and clarifies the evaluation criteria: the image had to become responsive within 5 minutes, and any discrepancies or bugs should be reported by Tuesday for potential score adjustments. The final scores will be normalized based on the highest-scoring submissions, including a sample solution provided by the instructor. A discourse thread is provided for further inquiries.

The prerequisites involved setting up a GitHub repository and Docker image according to specific guidelines. The email lists five requirements: 1. **Public GitHub Repository:** The student's GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible. 2. **MIT License:** The repository must include a LICENSE file using the MIT license. 3. **Valid Dockerfile:** The repository must contain a valid `Dockerfile`. 4. **Public Docker Image:** A Docker image built from the `Dockerfile` must be publicly accessible and runnable using a provided command. 5. **Consistent Dockerfile:** The Docker image must use the same `Dockerfile` as in the GitHub repository. The evaluation section shows that while the Docker image is present and public, the student failed to meet the other prerequisites. Their GitHub repository is not public, lacks a `Dockerfile` in the root directory, and is missing an MIT license file. The student must correct these issues before their project will be graded.

The student, 22t1 se2002, submitted Project 1 for the TDS (likely a course or program) on January 25th. The project required several pre-requisites to be met before evaluation, all related to setting up a GitHub repository and Docker image. These included: 1. A publicly accessible GitHub repository. 2. An MIT license file within the repository. 3. A valid Dockerfile in the repository. 4. A publicly accessible Docker image. 5. The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the repository. The email shows that the student's Docker image was successfully present and public (PASS), but the other prerequisites were not met (FAIL). Specifically, the student's GitHub repository was not public, it lacked a `Dockerfile`, and it was missing the MIT license file. As a result, the student received a score of 0 for Project 1 and their submission was not evaluated. The email directs the student to a detailed evaluation page for more information.

For a student, here's a breakdown: **The Process:** The terminal shows the steps involved in building and running a Docker image. Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers (isolated environments).

Each layer is a snapshot of changes made during the build process. The time taken for each step is also displayed. * **Copying files:** The process copies files like `requirements.txt` (containing dependencies for the application) into the image. * **Installing dependencies:** The `RUN pip install` command installs Python packages specified in `requirements.txt` inside the Docker container. * **Exporting layers and manifest:** The build process exports various artifacts to create a complete image. * **Running the application:** The final command `docker run` executes the built image, starting a server (likely a web application running Uvicorn, indicated by the final INFO message). The `-p 8000:8000` maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. **What a student should understand:** * **Docker Basics:** The image demonstrates the fundamental steps in creating and deploying a Docker application. * **Build Process:** The build is layered for efficiency. Changing a small part of the application only requires rebuilding the affected layers, making the process faster. * **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` highlights the importance of managing application dependencies. * **Containerization:** The process isolates the application within a container, making it portable and reproducible across different environments. * **Port Mapping:** Mapping ports allows access to the application running inside the container from outside. **In a student assignment context:** This could represent the output of a project involving Docker, perhaps for deploying a web application or microservice.

{"id": "discourse_603730_0", "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/28", "type": "discourse_post"}

Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB.

{"id": "discourse_604641_0", "content": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s ? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it. image 1214×831 34.8 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/6/f6860bd3cad2b025acf1216565bc8c8092398b35_2_690x472.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a web application called \"IIT Madras Assignment Helper.\" It's designed to help students at IIT Madras (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) with their Data Science assignments.

The question asks for a DuckDB SQL query to retrieve post IDs meeting specific criteria (a timestamp and at least one comment with a useful star rating of 5 or more), and the answer provides the SQL code to solve the problem. The tool also offers the option to upload an entire assignment file for help, although this is optional. The interface is user-friendly, with clear prompts and a \"Get Answer\" button.

Let's break down the components: * **`curl -X POST ...`**: This line initiates a POST request to a web API located at `https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`. This suggests the student is interacting with a server-side application, potentially for submitting code or receiving data for a task. The API endpoint is likely designed to handle the student's request. * **`More? -F \"question=...`**: This shows the student is providing a question to the API. The question describes a series of steps: downloading a zip file (`qmove.zip`), extracting it, moving all files to a new folder, renaming files by incrementing each digit (e.g., '1' becomes '2', '9' becomes '0'), and finally asking what the output of a specific command sequence would be. This command sequence is: `grep * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`. * **`More? -F \"file=@...`**: This indicates the student is uploading the `qmove.zip` file itself to the API as part of their submission. The file path suggests a local directory structure used by the student. * **`{\"answer\":\"text\\ne086115d65479e8562262a61e17e4568880561732b2d6e81117e041681883191\"}`**: This is the API's JSON response, providing the \"answer\" to the posed question. The answer is a SHA256 checksum, suggesting the command `sha256sum` is likely applied to the result of the file manipulation steps described in the question. This confirms the challenge involves file manipulation and checksum verification. In summary, the image shows a student working on a coding problem that involves: 1. API interaction: Sending a request containing a question and a file. 2. File manipulation: Downloading, extracting, moving, and renaming files according to specific rules. 3. Command-line tools: Using `grep`, `sort`, and `sha256sum` commands in bash. 4. Checksum verification: The final answer is a SHA256 hash, demonstrating that the complete process was successfully performed. The exercise tests the student's understanding of file system operations, command-line tools, and potentially, the ability to interact with an API.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/40", "type": "discourse_post"}

For students learning about APIs and web development, it explains: * **API Endpoint:** The application has a specific address (`https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`) where it receives requests. This is the URL you send data to. * **POST Request:** The API only accepts data sent using the HTTP POST method. This method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. * **Data Types:** The API can handle data sent in two ways: * **Question (presumably in the form of parameters):** Some data is sent as part of the request itself (likely in a format like JSON). * **File Attachments (optional):** Additionally, files can be sent as part of the request using the `multipart/form-data` encoding. This is a common way to upload files through a web form. In short, the instructions tell students they need to send a POST request to a specific URL, including both textual data (a \"question\") and potentially files. They'll need to use a programming language or tool (like curl or Postman) that supports POST requests and `multipart/form-data` encoding to interact with this API.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/42", "type": "discourse_post"}

Students are asked to input the formula `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))` into Google Sheets and provide the result. The formula uses `SEQUENCE` to generate a sequence of numbers, `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN` to limit the size of the array, and `SUM` to add the numbers. The question emphasizes that this formula is not compatible with Excel. **Question 2:** This question tests knowledge of Excel functions specifically available in Office 365. Students are instructed to enter `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY((3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14),(10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12)),1,9))` into Excel and determine the result. The formula uses `SORTBY` to sort numbers based on a second array, `TAKE` to take a subset of the sorted array, and `SUM` to calculate the sum. The question highlights the formula's incompatibility with older versions of Excel and suggests finding a classmate using Office 365 if the student receives a `#NAME?` error. The assessment focuses on the application of advanced spreadsheet functions, particularly those that differ between Google Sheets and Excel. It assesses both the ability to accurately enter and interpret complex formulas and understanding of the limitations of different spreadsheet software versions. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/5/7526d6eeacedc3b8dbec38fd07fb631d503f0665.png [Caption] This image shows a student exercise involving spreadsheet formulas. The exercise is split into two parts: **Part 1: Google Sheets** Students are asked to enter the formula `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))` into Google Sheets and determine the result. The instruction explicitly states that this formula will *not* work in Microsoft Excel. This part tests the student's understanding of Google Sheets' specific functions like `SEQUENCE` and `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`. **Part 2: Microsoft Excel (Office 365)** Students are asked to enter the formula `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))` into Microsoft Excel (Office 365 version only). The formula uses functions like `SORTBY` and `TAKE`, testing the student's understanding of these functions within the Excel environment. The note warns that the formula will produce `#NAME?` error if used with older versions of Excel. The overall purpose of the exercise is to assess the student's ability to correctly use spreadsheet formulas in both Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel, highlighting the differences between the two platforms' function libraries and syntax.

The instructions tell the student to: 1. **Install and run Visual Studio Code:** This assumes the student has not yet installed the popular code editor. 2. **Open the terminal:** Students are directed to the built-in terminal within VS Code (or a separate system terminal). 3. **Type the command `code -s` and press Enter:** This is the core instruction. `code` is the command to launch VS Code, and `-s` is a command-line flag/argument. The student must run this command and observe the output. 4. **Copy and paste the output:** Whatever text appears in the terminal after running the command, should be copied and submitted as the answer. The question is testing the student's ability to follow instructions, use the command line, and understand the function of `code -s`. The `-s` flag likely relates to a specific VS Code feature (like opening in a new window or related to certain settings). The output is expected to provide information about this function.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/56", "type": "discourse_post"}

The problem involves using the `httpie` Python package to send an HTTPS request. The instructions tell the student to: 1. **Install and use `httpie`:** The command `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` installs the `httpie` package and then sends a HTTPS request to a specified URL. Note that `[URL]` is a placeholder and the actual URL is given in the next step. 2. **Send an HTTPS request:** The student needs to send an HTTPS GET request to `https://httpbin.org/get`. This request must include a URL-encoded parameter named `email` with the value `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. 3. **Determine the JSON output:** The student needs to determine the JSON output of the command and only paste the JSON body (excluding the headers). A partially completed JSON response is shown, but the student needs to complete the code and provide the full body. Essentially, the question assesses the student's understanding of using `httpie` to make HTTP requests, handling URL parameters, and interpreting JSON responses. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/1/f1de22987816c7573909f6afd79942cfc41e06b6.png [Caption] This image shows a coding problem for students learning about HTTP requests and the Python `httpie` library. The problem describes a command that uses `uv run --with httpie` to send an HTTPS GET request to a URL (`https://httpbin.org/get`). The request includes a URL-encoded parameter named \"email\" with the value \"21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\". The student's task is to determine and provide the JSON response body (excluding headers) that the command returns. The partially completed JSON response is shown, indicating the expected structure containing \"args\" and \"headers\" sections. The student needs to fill in the missing parts of the \"headers\" and likely a section of \"data\" depending on what the `httpbin.org/get` endpoint returns. The \"Check\" button likely submits the student's answer for verification. This exercise tests the student's understanding of: * **HTTP Requests:** Sending GET requests and understanding URL parameters. * **JSON:** Understanding the structure and format of JSON data. * **Python Packages:** Using the `httpie` package for making HTTP requests. * **Command-Line Interfaces:** Understanding and interpreting command-line instructions.

The code defines a JSON object containing an email address (\"21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\") as an argument and headers for a web request (likely `Accept` and `Accept-Encoding`). Students studying computer science, particularly those working with web technologies like REST APIs or network programming, would recognize this as a common pattern for constructing requests. The email address suggests it might be related to a student's IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) account. The incomplete nature of the code indicates it's a partial view of a larger program.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/78", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student learning about data structures and JSON in Python would find this useful. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **`jobj`:** This variable is used to store JSON data. Initially, it's a string representation of a JSON object (lines 28 & 29). * **`'{\"name\":\"jivraj\"}'`:** This is a JSON string. It represents a simple JSON object with a single key-value pair: `\"name\"` with the value `\"jivraj\"`. Note the double quotes around the keys and values – this is important in JSON syntax. * **`json.loads(jobj)`:** This line uses the `json.loads()` function from the `json` library. This function takes a JSON string (like `jobj`) as input and parses it into a Python dictionary. This dictionary is a more usable data structure in Python. * **`json.loads(jobj)['name']`:** This accesses the value associated with the key `\"name\"` from the Python dictionary created in the previous step. It extracts the string `\"jivraj\"`. * **`type(jobj)`:** This uses the `type()` function to check the data type of `jobj`. The output `str` confirms that `jobj` is a string before being parsed by `json.loads()`. **Key Concepts Illustrated:** * **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight text-based data-interchange format. * **Python Dictionaries:** A key-value data structure in Python, analogous to JSON objects. * **JSON Parsing:** The process of converting a JSON string into a usable data structure within a programming language. `json.loads()` is the tool used here. * **Data Type:** Understanding the difference between a string representation of JSON (`str`) and the parsed dictionary. This example is a good illustration of how to work with JSON data in Python, a common task in many programming contexts, especially those dealing with web APIs or data exchange.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/79", "type": "discourse_post"}

The code first defines a JSON object `response` containing a nested structure. It then uses `json.dumps()` to serialize this object into a formatted JSON string, which is printed to the console. Next, the code uses `json.loads()` to parse the JSON string back into a Python dictionary. It specifically extracts the value associated with the key `\"answer\"` from the parsed JSON. The result, which is another JSON object, is then printed to the console. This shows how data can be encoded and decoded using the `json` library. Finally, a simple print statement expresses excitement, likely because the process of encoding and decoding the JSON data was successful as expected. The overall example highlights fundamental JSON manipulation in Python, a valuable skill for many programming tasks.

A student learning about data serialization and deserialization would find this useful. Specifically: 1. **JSON Data Creation:** A Python dictionary called `response` is created, containing a nested JSON structure. This represents a typical scenario where data needs to be packaged in a standard format for sending (e.g., to an API). 2. **JSON Serialization (`json.dumps`):** The `json.dumps()` function converts the Python dictionary into a JSON string. The `indent=2` argument formats the JSON string for better readability. 3. **JSON String Representation:** The serialized JSON string is printed to the console. This shows the JSON's structure as a string. 4. **JSON Deserialization (`json.loads`):** The `json.loads()` function converts the JSON string back into a Python dictionary, extracting only the 'answer' part of the JSON data. This highlights how JSON data can be received and processed. 5. **Extracted Data:** The deserialized data (the dictionary inside the `'answer'` key) is printed to the console, showcasing the successful parsing of the JSON string. 6. **A Celebratory Print Statement:** A final line prints an excited message, suggesting that the student is successfully using `json.dumps` and `json.loads` methods. In short, the example illustrates a common workflow: converting Python objects to JSON for transmission and converting JSON received from some source back into Python objects for further processing. This is crucial for many programming tasks involving data exchange.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/80", "type": "discourse_post"}

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

The code's purpose is to authenticate a user with their Google account, retrieve their email address using the Google APIs, and then generate a 5-character hash from a combination of the email and the year of token expiry. The code begins by importing necessary libraries (`hashlib`, `requests`, `google.colab.auth`, and `oauth2client.client`). It then authenticates the user using `auth.authenticate_user()`, obtains Google credentials, and retrieves an access token. A request is sent to the Google userinfo endpoint to get the user's email. Finally, it uses `hashlib.sha256` to create a SHA-256 hash of the email address concatenated with the token expiry year, returning only the last 5 characters of the resulting hexadecimal digest. The question at the bottom asks the student to determine the 5-character hash generated by the program after execution. This requires executing the code within Google Colab and observing the output. The output will be a 5-character string representing the last five characters of the SHA256 hash. The assignment likely aims to test the student's understanding of Python programming, Google APIs usage, and basic hashing techniques.

The code's purpose is to authenticate a user, retrieve their email address using the Google OAuth2 API, and then generate a 5-character hash based on the email and the token expiry year. Specifically: * **Authentication:** The code first authenticates the user using Google Colab's `auth.authenticate_user()`. * **API Call:** It then makes an API request to the Google userinfo endpoint to get the user's email address. * **Hash Generation:** Finally, it uses the `hashlib` library to create a SHA256 hash of the email address concatenated with the token's expiry year. Only the last 5 characters of this hash are retained as the final output. The question at the bottom of the image asks the student to run the code and provide the resulting 5-character string. The code is designed as a small exercise in authentication, API interaction, and basic string manipulation. The use of the Google Colab environment is crucial because of the `auth.authenticate_user()` function.

GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/107", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_611875_0", "content": "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

It shows a successful (200 OK) response from a server containing a JSON object with a URL as its value. The response headers also show details about the server, content type, and caching. The right side presents a learning exercise or quiz related to GitHub Pages. It explains that GitHub Pages uses Cloudflare, which obfuscates emails. The task is to identify the correct GitHub Pages URL from an example given. The student correctly identified the URL, marked by a green checkmark. The instructions also explain how to bypass the cache if changes aren't reflected immediately. The exercise is likely designed to teach students about how GitHub Pages works, including the URL structure, caching mechanisms, and how Cloudflare impacts the user experience.

The left side displays the results of an API request made to a local server (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`). The server responded with HTTP status code 200 (success) and a JSON payload containing a GitHub Pages URL: `https://21f3001076.github.io/github-pages-20250327144836/`. The response headers show that the server allows cross-origin requests and includes relevant metadata. The right side provides context and instructions. It explains that GitHub Pages uses CloudFlare, which obfuscates emails (as demonstrated by the email example using HTML comments). The student is then tasked with identifying the correct GitHub Pages URL from the API response, which is successfully identified and marked as \"Correct\". Finally, it gives instructions on how to clear the cache if changes are not immediately reflected using URL parameters (?v=1, ?v=2). In essence, the image illustrates a common workflow in web development: making API requests to fetch data (in this case, a URL), understanding server responses, and working with GitHub Pages deployment. The inclusion of the email obfuscation and caching instructions adds a layer of practical, real-world application.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/126", "type": "discourse_post"}
{"id": "discourse_611884_0", "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields: IP: The IP address of the visitor. Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this. Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts: (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g.

The file, 61MB in size and compressed with gzip, contains 258,074 rows, each representing a website visit to `s-anand.net` in May 2024. The task is divided into two parts: **Part 1: Data Filtering** Students must filter the log file to extract only those entries meeting specific criteria: * **Date:** The request must have been made on 2024-05-15. * **URL:** The URL requested must begin with `/malayalammp3/`. **Part 2: Data Aggregation** After filtering, students need to aggregate the data by IP address. For each unique IP address present in the filtered dataset, they must calculate the sum of the \"Size\" field. The \"Size\" field represents the size of the response in bytes for each request. The image also provides detailed information about the structure of each log entry, including the meaning and format of each field (IP address, time, request method, URL, status code, response size, referrer URL, user agent, virtual host, and server IP address). It highlights important considerations like the non-quoted nature of the \"Time\" field and the escaping of quotes within quoted fields. Students need to understand these details to successfully process the log file. The data is in GMT-0500 timezone, which is relevant for date filtering.

The file, a 61MB gzipped file containing 258,074 rows, logs website activity for `s-anand.net` during May 2024. Each log entry contains various fields, including the visitor's IP address, the request made (method, URL, protocol), the response status and size, the user agent, and the referer URL. The data has some quirks: the timestamp isn't quoted, and quoted fields use escaped quotes (`\\\"`). The assignment has two parts: 1. **Filtering:** Students must extract only the log entries matching specific criteria: requests whose URL starts with `/malayalammp3/` and which occurred on 2024-05-15. 2. **Aggregation:** After filtering, students must then group the remaining entries by the visitor's IP address and calculate the sum of the \"Size\" field for each unique IP address.

The task assesses students' ability to: * Work with large datasets. * Handle various data formats and quirks (e.g., escaped quotes, unquoted timestamps). * Apply filtering and aggregation techniques. * Likely, use programming skills (likely Python with libraries like pandas) to process the data efficiently due to the dataset's size.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/132", "type": "discourse_post"}

While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. @carlton I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint. How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE. It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?

Let's break it down for a student: **1. Imports:** * `import json`: This line imports the `json` library, which is crucial for handling data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, the format used for communication with the OpenAI API. **2. API Interaction:** * `my_response`, `url`, and `headers`: These variables define the API endpoint (`url`), the authentication header (`headers` – containing a placeholder \"dummy_api_key\"), and a variable to store the API response (`my_response`). The API call is to OpenAI's chat completions endpoint. * `data`: This dictionary structures the request sent to the OpenAI API. It specifies the model to use (`gpt-40-mini`), and importantly, the prompt (`messages`). The prompt instructs the model to analyze sentiment and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. The example text to analyze is included in the `content` of the user message. * `response = httpx.post(...)`: This line makes a POST request to the OpenAI API using the `httpx` library (not shown, but assumed to be imported elsewhere). It sends the `data` using the specified `headers`. * `raise_for_status()`: This important function checks if the API request was successful. If there's an error (like a bad API key or network issue), it will raise an exception, stopping the program. * `result = response.json()`: The JSON response from OpenAI is parsed into a Python dictionary. **3. Sentiment Analysis Function:** * `def analyze_sentiment():`: This defines a function that encapsulates the API interaction. **4. Main Execution Block:** * `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`: This is a standard Python idiom. The code within this block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module). * `try...except`: This error handling block attempts to execute the `analyze_sentiment()` function and prints the result. If any exception (`Exception as e`) occurs (e.g., network error, API error), an error message is printed. **5. Output:** * `print(json.loads(my_response)[\"answer\"])`: This line extracts the \"answer\" field from the JSON response and prints it to the console, showing the sentiment classification (GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL). **In summary:** This code demonstrates a simple workflow for sentiment analysis using the OpenAI API. It highlights important aspects of API interaction (authentication, request formatting, error handling), JSON data processing, and function definition in Python. A student should understand the purpose of each code block and the data flow from the API call to the final output. The placeholder API key should be replaced with a real one for the code to work.

It demonstrates how to work with JSON data. * **`import json`**: This line imports the `json` library, which is necessary for handling JSON data in Python. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. * **`my_response = {\"answer\": \"26272\"}`**: This line creates a Python dictionary named `my_response`. This dictionary represents a JSON object with a single key-value pair: `\"answer\"` as the key and `\"26272\"` as the string value. * **`print(my_response[\"answer\"])`**: This line accesses and prints the value associated with the `\"answer\"` key in the `my_response` dictionary. The `[\"answer\"]` part is used to index into the dictionary. * **`26272`**: This is the output of the `print` statement, showing the value retrieved from the JSON data. In a student context, this example would be useful for illustrating: * **JSON data structures**: How JSON objects are represented in Python as dictionaries. * **Dictionary access**: How to access values within a dictionary using keys. * **Importing modules**: The importance of importing necessary libraries like `json`. * **Basic input/output**: The use of the `print` function to display data. This code is simple and directly shows the process of parsing a JSON string and extracting specific information from it. It's a foundational example for further exploration of JSON handling in Python. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b2c5345c348f63fcf52240ba6c07cb8655d7d17c.png [Caption] This image shows a Python code snippet demonstrating how to work with JSON data. For a student context: * **`import json`**: This line imports the `json` library, which provides functions for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. JSON is a common format for transmitting data, often used in web applications and APIs. * **`my_response = \"{\\\"answer\\\": \\\"26272\\\"}\"`**: This line creates a string variable `my_response` containing a JSON object. The object has a single key-value pair: `\"answer\"` is the key, and `\"26272\"` is its value (a string representation of a number). The backslashes are used for escaping double quotes within the string. * **`print(json.loads(my_response)[\"answer\"])`**: This line does the following: * `json.loads(my_response)`: This uses the `loads()` function from the `json` library to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary. The dictionary will have a single key \"answer\" with a value of \"26272\". * `[\"answer\"]`: This accesses the value associated with the key \"answer\" in the dictionary. * `print(...)`: This prints the value to the console. * **`26272`**: This is the output of the `print` statement—the value associated with the \"answer\" key in the JSON data. In short, the code demonstrates how to: 1. Import the JSON library. 2. Create a JSON string. 3. Parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary. 4. Access and print a specific value within the JSON data. This is a basic but important example for students learning about data manipulation and parsing.

Let's break it down for a student: **Purpose:** The code aims to send text to the OpenAI API, which will then analyze the text's sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The result is then printed to the console. **Key Components:** * **`import json`:** Imports the `json` library, necessary for handling JSON data (the format OpenAI uses for communication). * **`import httpx`:** Imports the `httpx` library, used for making HTTP requests to the OpenAI API. * **`analyze_sentiment()` function:** This function encapsulates the core logic: * It defines the API endpoint (`url`), headers (including an authorization token - replaced with \"dummy_api_key\" in this example), and the data payload (containing the text to be analyzed and instructions for the API). Note the importance of replacing \"dummy_api_key\" with a real API key. * It makes a POST request to the OpenAI API using `httpx.post()`. * It handles potential errors using `response.raise_for_status()` which checks for HTTP error codes. * It parses the JSON response using `response.json()`. * It returns the sentiment analysis result. * **Main execution block (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)** * This section calls the `analyze_sentiment()` function. * It uses a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during the API call. If an error occurs, it prints an error message. * It prints the final sentiment analysis result. * **`my_response` dictionary:** This variable appears to be designed to store the result. However, its usage is incomplete in the provided snippet, as it only assigns the `answer` key to the function's definition. It would need additional code to actually receive and utilize the results. **Educational Points:** * **API Interaction:** This code demonstrates a common pattern for interacting with APIs—making a request with specific headers and data, handling responses, and processing JSON data. * **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block showcases best practices for robust code by handling potential exceptions. * **Function Definition:** The `analyze_sentiment()` function demonstrates the concept of modularity and code organization. * **Sentiment Analysis:** The code provides a practical example of a real-world application of natural language processing (NLP). **Improvements:** The code could be improved by: * **Replacing `\"dummy_api_key\"` with a valid OpenAI API key.** * **Completing the `my_response` dictionary usage:** The code should store and then use the results from the API call, rather than just holding the function definition. * **Adding more sophisticated error handling:** A more informative error message could be provided in the `except` block. More specific exceptions could be caught. * **Input from the User:** The code could be modified to take the text input from the user instead of hardcoding it. This explanation should help a student understand the code's functionality and the underlying concepts.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/157", "type": "discourse_post"}

Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

However, if we load a JSON object directly using json.load() , it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using json.loads( ) . For clarity I add image below. This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big. I guess @Jivraj is right. image 562×700 23.4 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/8/e82e8179f7619de01201d2c52d72b62aedcb369c.png [Caption] This image shows a Python code snippet and its execution results, highlighting a common error in JSON handling. **The Problem:** The initial code attempts to load a JSON object directly using `json.loads()`. The `my_response` variable is a Python dictionary, not a JSON string. `json.loads()` expects a JSON string (a string representation of a JSON object) as input, not a Python dictionary. This leads to a `TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray`. **The Solution:** The corrected code demonstrates the solution. It uses `json.dumps()` to convert the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON string before passing it to `json.loads()`. `json.dumps()` serializes the Python object into a JSON string representation, which `json.loads()` can then correctly parse. **Learning Points for Students:** * **JSON Data Types:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format for data exchange. It's crucial to understand that Python dictionaries are not directly equivalent to JSON objects. They need to be converted to JSON strings using `json.dumps()` before being parsed with `json.loads()`. * **`json.loads()` and `json.dumps()`:** These are essential functions in Python's `json` module. `json.loads()` parses a JSON string into a Python object (like a dictionary or list), while `json.dumps()` serializes a Python object into a JSON string. * **Error Handling:** The traceback shows how Python reports the error, including the line number and the specific error message. Learning to read and understand these messages is crucial for debugging. * **Data Types in Programming:** The error emphasizes the importance of understanding data types and how functions handle different types of input. In this case, mixing dictionary and string types caused the issue. In summary, this image serves as a practical example of a common programming error and its correction, teaching students about JSON handling, data type conversions, and error messages in Python.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/184", "type": "discourse_post"}

The task involves: 1. **Data Acquisition:** Students must use IMDb's advanced search (link provided) to find movie data. 2. **Data Filtering:** They need to filter the results to include only movies with ratings between 2 and 8. 3. **Data Formatting:** The students must extract the movie ID (found in the `href` attribute of each movie's URL after \"tt\"), title, year, and rating for the first 25 movies that meet the rating criteria. This data must then be formatted into a JSON array of objects, with each object representing a movie and containing the extracted information (as shown in the example JSON snippet). 4. **Submission:** Finally, students must submit the generated JSON data into a text box (not shown in the image). The assignment tests the students' abilities in web scraping, data manipulation, and JSON formatting. It emphasizes practical application of programming skills to retrieve, process, and structure real-world data. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/0/e010f5c327843dec9c8f355ca5bc35830300c3f8.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a code snippet written in JavaScript, likely part of a larger program designed to retrieve and process data from the IMDb website. For students, here's a breakdown: * **Purpose:** The code aims to fetch information about movies or TV shows from IMDb, specifically their ID, title, year, and rating. It uses a proxy server ('/proxy/https://...'), suggesting that direct access to IMDb might be restricted or rate-limited. * **`fetch` and `async/await`:** The code uses modern JavaScript features `fetch` (to make HTTP requests) and `async/await` (to handle asynchronous operations cleanly). It waits for the response from IMDb and then extracts the relevant data. * **Error Handling:** It includes a `try...catch` block (although only the `catch` is explicitly visible), which handles potential errors during the data retrieval process. If there's a problem, an error message is thrown. * **DOM Parsing:** The `DOMParser` object is used to parse the HTML response from IMDb. The `querySelectorAll` method then selects specific elements within the HTML using CSS selectors (like `.ipc-title-link-wrapper`, `.ipc-title_text`). This demonstrates knowledge of web scraping techniques and familiarity with HTML structure. * **Data Extraction:** The code uses methods like `getAttribute`, `textContent`, and regular expressions (`match(/(tt\\d+)/)`) to extract the desired pieces of information (ID, title, year, rating) from the selected HTML elements. The regular expression extracts the IMDb ID (tt followed by numbers) from a string. * **Data Structure:** The extracted data is structured into a JavaScript object `{id: m, title: b, year: S, rating: w}`. This illustrates the use of objects to organize and represent data. * **Potential Issues:** The code seems to be handling a single movie entry. Error handling is partially shown, but more robust error handling would be beneficial (e.g., handling different types of errors). In a student context, this code demonstrates practical application of several important concepts: * **Web Scraping:** Extracting data from a website. * **Asynchronous Programming:** Handling requests and responses from external sources. * **DOM Manipulation:** Parsing HTML to extract specific information. * **Regular Expressions:** Pattern matching for extracting specific data parts. * **Error Handling:** Managing potential failures during data retrieval. * **Data Structures:** Creating and using objects to structure data. The code could be improved by using more descriptive variable names and more comprehensive error handling. However, it showcases several key programming concepts in a real-world scenario. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/0/e010f5c327843dec9c8f355ca5bc35830300c3f8_2_690x189.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a JavaScript function designed to retrieve and process data from IMDb. Let's break down its components for a student audience: **1. Fetching Data:** The code first makes a fetch request to an IMDb search URL (hidden behind a proxy `/proxy/`). The URL likely dynamically incorporates user-specified rating parameters (`r`, `n`). The response is then checked for success (`h.ok`). If the fetch fails, an error is thrown. **2. Parsing HTML:** The successful response (HTML from IMDb) is parsed using `DOMParser`. This converts the raw HTML into a format JavaScript can work with. **3. Data Extraction:** The core of the function uses `querySelectorAll` to select specific elements within the HTML. These selectors target elements containing the movie's ID, title, year, and rating. The `.textContent` property extracts the text content of these elements. A regular expression (`match(/(tt\\d+)/)`) extracts the movie ID from a more complex string. **4. Return Value:** Finally, the function returns an object containing the extracted data: `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating`. This structured object makes the data easier to use in other parts of the application. **In a Student Context:** This code exemplifies several important concepts in web development and programming: * **Asynchronous Operations:** The `async` and `await` keywords handle the asynchronous nature of network requests, ensuring the program doesn't halt while waiting for the response. * **Web Scraping:** The code scrapes data from a website using specific selectors. This is a common technique, but ethical considerations (respecting website terms of service and robots.txt) are crucial. * **DOM Manipulation:** The `DOMParser` and `querySelectorAll` demonstrate how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), the tree-like structure representing an HTML document. * **Data Structures:** The code uses objects to organize the extracted data, which is a fundamental data structure in JavaScript. * **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block (not fully shown but implied) is essential for handling potential errors during the fetching and parsing process. **Potential Improvements (for a student to consider):** * **Error handling:** More robust error handling would improve reliability. A more informative error message could be created, maybe identifying the specific issue that caused the failure. * **Efficiency:** The code could be optimized for speed and efficiency by using more efficient selectors or libraries. * **Readability:** Adding comments to explain complex parts of the code would enhance readability. This code provides a practical example of fetching, parsing, and extracting data from a web page, combining several key concepts relevant to a computer science student's curriculum.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/187", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break it down: **1. API Endpoint and Functionality:** The top line indicates a `POST` request to the `/api` endpoint. This endpoint is designed to accept a CSV file (Comma Separated Values) containing student data. The description clarifies that it returns student data and allows optional filtering by class using query parameters in the URL (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B` filters results to students in classes 1A and 1B). **2. Parameters Section:** This section allows the user to specify parameters for the API request: * **`class` (array ):** This is a crucial parameter. It's an array, meaning you can specify multiple classes to filter. The user can input class names like \"1A\" and \"1B\" into the input fields. **3. Request Body:** This section shows how to upload the CSV file: * **`file`:** This is a required field where the student selects a CSV file using the \"Choose file\" button. The API expects the file to be in a format that it can process. **4. Execute Button:** Clicking \"Execute\" sends the POST request to the API server with the selected CSV file and any specified class filters. **5. Responses Section:** After the \"Execute\" button is pressed, the API's response appears in this section: * **Curl Command:** Shows the equivalent `curl` command used to make the API call. This is useful for recreating the request outside of this interface. It shows the HTTP method (`POST`), the URL, headers (`accept` and `Content-Type`), and the file being sent. * **Request URL:** Displays the complete URL used in the API request, including the query parameters. * **Server Response:** * **Code (200):** A status code indicating the request was successful (HTTP status 200 OK). * **Response Body:** Shows the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data returned by the API. In this case, it's a list of students, each with a `studentId` and `class`. **In short:** This is a visual representation of a student interacting with an API to upload and retrieve information from a CSV file. The image likely comes from a learning environment showcasing API interaction using a user-friendly interface. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/e/3e7a25395a022241598f1dadada2c71d31ae491e_2_552x500.png [Caption] This image shows a student's interface for interacting with an API (Application Programming Interface). Specifically, it's likely a testing environment for an API endpoint that handles CSV (Comma Separated Value) files related to student data. **Key Features for a Student's Understanding:** * **API Endpoint:** `/api` is the base URL of the API, and `/UploadCsv` is the specific endpoint for uploading CSV files. The URL also shows how optional query parameters (`?class=1A&class=1B`) can filter the results. * **POST Request:** The `POST` method indicates that the student is sending data *to* the API (as opposed to retrieving data via a `GET` request). * **Parameters:** The \"Parameters\" section allows the student to specify query parameters. In this case, the `class` parameter is used to filter student data by class (e.g., \"1A\", \"1B\"). This is optional. * **Request Body:** The \"Request body\" section allows the student to select a CSV file (`file`) to upload. It specifies the file type as `multipart/form-data`, a common format for sending files over HTTP. * **Execute Button:** This button sends the request to the API server. * **Responses:** This section shows the results of the API call. * **Curl Command:** The `curl` command is a way to manually interact with the API using the command line. This provides a textual representation of the request. * **Request URL:** Shows the complete URL used for the request, including the query parameters. * **Server Response:** Provides the HTTP status code (200 OK in this case, indicating success). * **Response Body:** Shows the JSON data returned by the API. This is a list of student objects, each containing a `studentId` and `class`. **In Summary:** This image depicts a common scenario in software development and API testing. A student is likely using this tool to learn about API interactions, file uploads, and data handling in a real-world context. They're testing an API that manages student data, and the response demonstrates successful retrieval of student information based on the provided class filter (or lack thereof).", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/191", "type": "discourse_post"}

The top section outlines three key goals: * **Competitive Intelligence:** Gathering information on developer trends to inform recruitment strategies. This suggests a focus on understanding the market and competition. * **Efficiency:** Automating data collection to save time and improve recruiter productivity. This points towards the use of programming and automation tools. * **Data-Driven Decisions:** Using data to make informed decisions in recruitment and market research. This highlights the importance of data analysis and interpretation. The middle section requires the student to input a date (in ISO 8601 format), representing the date a new user joined GitHub. This is likely a parameter for a query or filter in their analysis. The bottom section provides instructions for a search query, emphasizing the use of specific fields (location, followers, joined, created_at) and sorting parameters (descending order). It also notes the exclusion of very recent users from the analysis. The date and time stamp at the very bottom likely show when these notes were created. In short, the image provides a high-level overview of the project goals and detailed instructions on how to gather and process the necessary data from GitHub using programming techniques and data analysis principles.

The top section outlines three key goals: improving **competitive intelligence**, increasing **efficiency**, and making **data-driven decisions** in talent acquisition. The bottom section describes how to find the date the newest GitHub user (excluding very recent users) joined, using a search function. It specifies using location and follower count as filters, sorting by join date (most recent first), retrieving the first result's URL, and extracting the \"created_at\" timestamp from that URL's data. The timestamp at the very bottom indicates the time this search query was executed (March 30th, 2025). The task implies students may be learning about data analysis, API usage (interacting with the GitHub API), or a combination of these skills to extract and analyze data for informed decisions.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/192", "type": "discourse_post"}

It's asking the user to decide which network ports should be accessible from the public internet. * **Options:** The user can choose either \"None\" (no public access), or \"Allow selected ports\" to specify which ports are open. * **Selected Port:** In this example, port 22 (SSH) is selected. SSH is a secure shell protocol commonly used for remote login and administration of servers. * **Security Warning:** A warning message highlights the security risk of allowing all IP addresses to access the virtual machine via port 22. This is generally considered insecure and should only be used for testing purposes. The message advises using more restrictive rules in the Networking tab for production environments. In a student context, this illustrates a critical aspect of network security: the importance of controlling access to systems. Opening ports unnecessarily exposes the system to potential attacks. The example emphasizes the need for careful consideration when configuring network security, especially in public cloud environments.

The task is to: 1. **Download data:** Download a JSON file (`q-vercel-python.json`) containing grades for 108 fictional students. 2. **Create and deploy a Python API:** Build a Python application and deploy it using Vercel. This API should accept GET requests with query parameters `name=X&name=Y`. 3. **Return JSON response:** The API should return a JSON response containing the grades for students X and Y in the order they were requested. An example response is provided: `{\"marks\": [10, 20]}`. 4. **Enable CORS:** The API must be configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from any origin. 5. **Provide Vercel URL:** The final step is to provide the deployed Vercel URL, which should follow a specific format (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`). An example URL is given: `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`. In short, the assignment tests students' ability to work with JSON data, build and deploy a simple REST API using Python and Vercel, and understand CORS.

Here's a breakdown in a student-friendly context: **The Goal:** The student needs to run a specific LLM model called \"Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile\". This model likely requires a server to operate. **The Steps:** 1. **Download `Llamafile`:** This is a prerequisite file or software needed to run the LLM. 2. **Run the Model:** Once downloaded, the student needs to execute the model file. 3. **Create a Tunnel with `ngrok`:** Because the LLM likely runs on a local server, `ngrok` is used to create a secure tunnel to allow external access to this local server. `ngrok` provides a temporary public URL for the local server. 4. **Find the `ngrok` URL:** The final step is to identify the public URL provided by `ngrok`. This URL allows others (or the student in a different environment) to interact with the running LLM. The example shows a typical format for this URL. The highlighted `https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app` is the student's specific URL generated by `ngrok`. In short, this is a guide on how to set up and access a locally-running large language model, making use of a tunneling service to connect a local server to the internet. The instructions are highly technical and assume the student has some familiarity with command-line interfaces and network tools.

The task involves: 1. **Downloading data:** Students must download a JSON file (`q-vercel-python.json`) containing the marks of 100 fictional students. 2. **Creating and deploying an API:** They need to build a Python application and deploy it using Vercel. This application will have an API endpoint. 3. **API functionality:** When a GET request is made to the API (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`), the API should return a JSON response containing the marks for students X and Y, in the order they are specified in the request. The response should be formatted like `{\"marks\": [markX, markY]}`. 4. **CORS configuration:** The students must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from any origin to access their API. 5. **Vercel URL:** Finally, the assignment asks the students to provide the correct Vercel URL for their deployed API, which will follow the pattern `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. An example URL is provided at the end. In essence, this is a practical exercise combining data handling (JSON), backend development (Python), API creation and deployment (Vercel), and understanding of CORS.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/233", "type": "discourse_post"}

The problem involves a table named `tickets` in a SQLite database. This table tracks customer bids for concert tickets, with each row representing a bid and containing the columns: * **type:** The type of ticket (e.g., \"bronze\", \"Bronze\", \"Silver\"). Note that capitalization might be inconsistent. * **units:** The number of tickets bid on. * **price:** The price per ticket. The question asks students to write a SQL query to calculate the total sales of \"Gold\" tickets. Since the sample data doesn't include any \"Gold\" ticket entries, the resulting SQL query should return 0. The exercise tests the students' understanding of SQL's `SUM()` function, `WHERE` clause for filtering by ticket type, and potentially the use of `UPPER()` or `LOWER()` if the case sensitivity of the \"type\" column needs to be addressed. The solution would likely be something like: ```sql SELECT SUM(units * price) FROM tickets WHERE UPPER(type) = 'GOLD'; ``` The lack of \"Gold\" data in the provided sample table makes this a good exercise in handling zero results gracefully and understanding the logic of the query. The presence of differing capitalization in the \"type\" column also introduces the importance of proper case handling in the SQL query.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/237", "type": "discourse_post"}

The request includes a question about ShopSmart, an online retail platform. The lower portion shows the server's response (HTTP status code 200, indicating success) and, importantly, the response body. This body contains a Python function designed to calculate the cosine similarity between pairs of word embeddings. The function then identifies and returns the pair of phrases with the highest cosine similarity. A long list of numerical data follows, which are likely the word embeddings themselves used as input to the function. The comments in the code explain what each section does, and the output shows several examples of the calculation including a final most similar pair. The overall task was likely to leverage an API to perform a semantic similarity analysis on phrases related to customer feedback on ShopSmart.

Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates from the popular anime and manga series *One Piece*. For a student assignment, one could describe it as follows: The image depicts the iconic black flag of the Straw Hat Pirates, featuring a stylized skull wearing a straw hat. The skull has large, expressive eyes and a wide grin, giving it a mischievous and somewhat playful appearance, which contrasts with the typical menacing nature of pirate flags. The skull's arms are extended into crossbones, a traditional symbol of piracy. The flag itself billows in the wind, suggesting movement and a sense of adventure. It is attached to a mast of a ship, clearly indicating its maritime context. The design is simple but effective, conveying the crew's playful yet determined nature. The straw hat specifically identifies the crew, distinguishing it from other pirate flags and serves as a visual shorthand for *One Piece* fans. The colors—mostly black and white with accents of orange/yellow from the hat— are bold and easily memorable, typical of anime aesthetics. The overall effect is instantly recognizable to fans of the series and symbolizes the crew's journey and adventures at sea.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/270", "type": "discourse_post"}

In a student context, this image could be used in several ways: * **Illustrating workplace communication:** The image could be used to discuss effective (or ineffective!) communication styles in a business setting. His slightly awkward demeanor could spark conversation about nonverbal cues and the importance of clear messaging. * **Analyzing character traits:** Students could analyze David Wallace's character. Is he trustworthy? Competent? How does his body language contribute to his overall persona? * **Showcasing a specific scene or episode:** The GIF could be part of a presentation about a particular episode of *The Office*, illustrating a key moment or plot point. * **Representing corporate culture:** The image reflects a certain type of corporate environment. It could be used to compare and contrast different workplace cultures discussed in a class. * **Meme/Humorous context:** Finally, given its popularity as a meme, it could simply be used humorously to emphasize a point or illustrate a relatable feeling, like awkwardness or uncertainty in a presentation.

The kitten's fur is soft-looking, and its overall posture is quite endearing. The background is a blurred image of a wooden floor.

Tom, the cat, is depicted kneeling on the ground with his paws pressed together as if in prayer. His eyes are closed, and his expression appears to be one of supplication or pleading. He seems to be begging for something or asking for forgiveness. The background suggests an outdoor setting, possibly a field or rural area. The overall mood is one of vulnerability and desperation. The scene is likely part of a larger narrative where Tom is facing a difficult situation.

He's on his knees, paws pressed together as if praying or begging. His expression is one of desperation or remorse. The background is a simple, outdoor setting suggesting a rural or desert landscape with muted colors and a sparse background. The overall style is consistent with classic animation techniques. The image could be used to illustrate concepts such as: * **Nonverbal communication:** Tom's body language clearly conveys his emotional state without words. * **Character expression in animation:** The image demonstrates how animators create emotion in a cartoon character. * **Storytelling in visuals:** The pose suggests a narrative element – Tom is likely in trouble and seeking help or forgiveness. It's a visual cue that might be analyzed for dramatic effect. This image could be used in a lesson about animation, character design, storytelling, or nonverbal communication.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/293", "type": "discourse_post"}

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

{"id": "discourse_614585_0", "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/315", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student might see this when testing an API or debugging a web application. * **200:** This code indicates a successful response from the server. The request was processed correctly. * **Response body:** This section contains the data returned by the server. In this case, it's a JSON object (indicated by curly braces `{}`) with a single key-value pair: `\"answer\": \"7a5955793fe63e199a06776330053c5011066589253280619659246b\"`. The value is a long hexadecimal string, likely representing some kind of data or identifier (a hash, session ID, etc.). * **Download button:** This allows the student to download the response body as a file. In short, a student would use this information to verify that a request was successful and to examine the data the server sent back. The hex string suggests a possible backend process might involve encryption or hashing. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/2/9201a514dc9b85f1bef21a9b90a225754a65072f_2_690x280.png [Caption] This image shows a user interface for making an API request. It's likely part of a software development or testing environment. Let's break down the student-relevant aspects: * **API Request:** The interface allows a student to send a request to an API (Application Programming Interface). APIs are how different software systems communicate with each other. This is a crucial concept in modern software development. * **Request Body:** This section defines the data being sent to the API. Notice the required fields \"question\" (a string) and \"file\" (which accepts a file upload, specifically a JSON file in this case). This illustrates how data is structured for API calls. The `multipart/form-data` indicates the way the data will be formatted. * **Parameters:** This section appears empty, showing there are no additional parameters needed for this specific request. * **Execute:** This button sends the request to the API. * **Responses:** This section (currently empty) is where the API's response would appear after the \"Execute\" button is clicked. This is where the student would see the result of their request. * **File Upload:** The ability to upload a `q-multi-cursor.json.txt` file suggests the request might involve processing data from that file. This demonstrates working with different data formats and external files in a programming context. * **\"question\" field:** This is a text input area where the student can provide a specific instruction or question which will probably be processed according to the content of the file. **In summary:** For a student learning about APIs, this interface provides a practical demonstration of: * Constructing and sending API requests. * Working with different data types (strings, files). * Handling API responses. * Understanding the role of parameters and request bodies. * File uploading and processing. The overall task appears to be sending a question and a file to the API, potentially for some type of processing or analysis related to the concept of \"multi-cursors,\" likely a feature from a text editor or similar program. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/2/9201a514dc9b85f1bef21a9b90a225754a65072f.png [Caption] This image shows a user interface for making an API request. It's likely part of a programming or software development course, possibly related to web development or data science. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **Parameters:** This section shows there are no additional parameters needed for this specific API call beyond the request body. * **Request Body:** This is the main part of the request. It specifies the data being sent to the API. The `required` tag indicates that this section must be filled. The API expects data in the `multipart/form-data` format, which allows sending both text and files. * **`question` (string):** This field requires a text string as input. The example given is \"Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single\". This suggests the API is designed to process a question or instruction. * **`file` (string | string | null ($binary)):** This field allows uploading a file. The notation `string | string | null ($binary)` indicates that it accepts either a string representation of the file, another string, or a binary file (represented by `$binary`). The example shows a `.txt` file (\"q-multi-cursor-json.txt\") being uploaded. This file probably contains data relevant to the `question`. * **\"Choose File\" button:** Allows the user to select a file from their computer to upload. * **\"Send empty value\" checkbox:** This allows the user to send the `file` field without any value. * **\"Execute\" button:** Sends the request to the API. * **\"Clear\" button:** Clears the input fields. * **\"Cancel\" and \"Reset\" buttons:** Standard buttons to cancel the current operation or reset the form to its default state. * **\"Responses\" and \"Curl\":** These suggest that the interface will display the API's response, potentially providing a `curl` command (used for making HTTP requests from a command line) to reproduce the request. In short, the image depicts a typical interaction with an API, requiring textual input (`question`) and an optional file upload (`file`). The student might be learning about: * **API interaction:** How to send requests to an API. * **Request formats:** Understanding `multipart/form-data`. * **Data types:** Working with strings and binary data. * **HTTP methods:** Although not explicitly shown, it's likely a POST request based on the request body. * **API documentation:** Interpreting API specifications and parameters. This would be a valuable exercise to demonstrate practical API usage within a broader programming context. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/d/dd6c4fed0a92c88924a7bf38b2e19497253fca36.png [Caption] This image shows a server response in a programming context, likely from an API call. A student might see this in a computer science or web development class. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **Server Response:** This indicates the result of a request sent to a server (a computer that provides information or services). * **Code 200:** This is an HTTP status code. `200 OK` means the request was successful. The server understood the request and fulfilled it. * **Response Body:** This section contains the data sent back by the server in response to the request. It's formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common way to transmit data. * **`\"answer\": \"...\"`:** This is a key-value pair within the JSON response. \"answer\" is the key, and the long string of characters following is the value. This value is likely a unique identifier (like a hash or token). The context of what the API call is would explain its meaning. * **Download Button:** This allows the user to download the response body, likely for further analysis or use in other applications. In short, the image displays a successful API call that returned a unique identifier, probably an important piece of data for a larger application. A student learning about APIs, web development, or server-side programming would encounter similar screens when testing their code or using online APIs.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/327", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_615157_0", "content": ": From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents —they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/341", "type": "discourse_post"}

It appears to be from a server-side log file, likely related to a web application or service. Each line represents a single request made to the server. The log entries include: * **Timestamp:** The date and time of the request. * **Source IP Address and Port:** The IP address and port number of the client making the request. * **HTTP Method:** The type of request (GET, POST, PROPFIND, etc.). GET retrieves data, POST submits data, and PROPFIND is used for WebDAV operations. * **Request Path:** The URL path requested by the client. These paths often reveal information about the application's structure and endpoints. Examples in the image are: `/`, `/t4`, `/favicon.ico`, `/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/logincheck`, `/actuator/health`, etc. * **HTTP Version:** The version of the HTTP protocol used (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1). * **Response Code:** A three-digit code indicating the server's response to the request. `200 OK` signifies a successful request, while `404 Not Found` means the requested resource wasn't found, and `405 Method Not Allowed` means the requested method was not allowed for that resource. **From a student's perspective:** This log could be used to illustrate concepts in computer networking, web development, or server-side programming. For example: * **HTTP request-response cycle:** The log shows the complete interaction between clients and the server. * **HTTP status codes:** Understanding the meaning of different status codes (200, 404, 405) is crucial for debugging web applications. * **Web server logs:** How servers record and store information about client requests. * **Debugging:** Analyzing the log helps in identifying errors, such as 404 errors indicating missing files or incorrect URLs, or 405 errors indicating incorrect HTTP method usage. * **Security:** The log may provide insights into potential security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is accidentally logged. The presence of requests to paths like `/.env` and `/.git/config` suggests that the application may have configuration files accessible directly, highlighting a potential security risk if left improperly configured in a production environment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/350", "type": "discourse_post"}

Many of these requests resulted in \"404 Not Found\" errors, indicating that the server couldn't find the requested resources. The log also shows several instances of \"Invalid HTTP request received,\" suggesting problems with the formatting or structure of some of the incoming requests. Finally, the log shows the server successfully shutting down. From a student perspective, this could be used to illustrate: * **HTTP request/response cycle:** The log displays the client IP addresses, the requested URLs (paths), the HTTP method (GET or POST), and the server's responses (404). This can help students understand how web servers process client requests. * **HTTP error codes:** The prevalence of \"404 Not Found\" errors demonstrates a common web server issue and the meaning of the 404 status code. * **Web server logs:** The log itself is an example of a real-world log file, showcasing valuable information for debugging and monitoring a web server. Students could learn how to interpret such logs to troubleshoot problems. * **Troubleshooting web applications:** The errors highlight common problems in web applications, like incorrect URLs or improperly formatted requests. Students could analyze these errors to learn debugging techniques. * **Network security:** The log entries reveal the IP addresses of various clients attempting to access the server. In a security context, this data could be used for analysis of potential threats or suspicious activities.

This indicates that clients (browsers, other programs) were attempting to access resources on the server that don't exist. The log also shows several \"Invalid HTTP request received\" warnings, suggesting problems with the format or structure of some of the incoming requests. Finally, the log shows the server successfully shutting down. For a student, this is a good example of: * **HTTP error codes:** Specifically, the 404 error code (\"Not Found\") is demonstrated repeatedly. * **Server logs:** The log entries show the IP addresses of the clients making requests, the timestamps, the requested URLs, and the HTTP status codes returned. This is typical of what web server logs contain. * **Debugging web applications:** The repeated 404 errors highlight a common problem in web development: incorrect URLs or missing resources. The \"Invalid HTTP request\" warnings suggest additional problems that need to be investigated. The student could learn to interpret these errors and fix the underlying issues causing them. * **Server administration:** The final lines show the server being shut down, a common task in server administration.

The `cost` and `monthlyCost` fields indicate a usage-based pricing model associated with the LLM API. * **Error Message:** A crucial part is the error \"crypto.createHash is not a function.\" This suggests a problem within the code used to interact with the API, specifically, a missing or incorrectly implemented cryptographic function. * **System Information:** The bottom lines show the server information (IP address and HTTP response) and the student's command prompt, which is within a project directory named `tds-solver`. The username implies this is likely a university system. * **Student Context:** The output shows that the student is using an LLM to automate tasks within VS Code, likely as part of a larger project. The error indicates a debugging step, needing to fix the `crypto.createHash` issue before the solution is complete. The overall context suggests a project focused on integrating LLMs with existing development environments.

The response details the execution of a function called \"solver_1,\" which interacts with a VS Code environment. For a student, the key takeaways are: * **API Interaction:** The output demonstrates a successful call to a remote API. This is fundamental in many modern applications, where different components communicate over networks. * **Function as a Service (FaaS):** The \"solver_1\" function hints at a Function-as-a-Service architecture, where code is executed on demand without managing servers. * **JSON Data Format:** The response is in JSON, a widely used data exchange format in web applications and APIs. The nested structure shows how complex data can be represented. * **Error Handling:** The \"costError\" field indicates an error encountered during execution (\"crypto.createHash is not a function\"). This highlights the importance of robust error handling in programming. * **Token Usage:** The \"usage\" section shows details on token consumption, which is relevant in contexts like large language models where costs are associated with processing text. The overall context suggests a student might be working on a project involving API interaction, potentially with a large language model or a code execution service, and that they are debugging a runtime error. The details are specific to a particular API and implementation, but the underlying concepts are broadly applicable in computer science.

The student is sending a POST request to a server at a specified address (`4.213.61.248:8080/api`). The request includes a key-value pair in the body, where the key is \"question\" and the value is \"what is output of -s?\". This suggests the student is querying the server for information related to the command-line argument `-s`. The server responds with a 200 OK status code, indicating success. The response body contains system information, including operating system version, CPU details, memory usage, and the status of various graphics rendering features (like OpenGL, canvas rendering, and compositing). This information is likely relevant to a programming assignment or project related to system information or graphics programming. The response suggests that the student's request was to retrieve system information and the server successfully fulfilled that request. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/5/0590dc73054cb36b3109f0338911fdc231ff0937_2_690x389.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a software tool, likely Postman or a similar API testing client, to send a POST request to an API endpoint. The student is querying the API to get system information, specifically the output of the `-s` command (likely a system information command). The request includes a key-value pair with the \"question\" key and the query \"what is output of -s?\" as its value. The response (200 OK) is a JSON payload containing detailed system information, including operating system version, CPU architecture, memory, and various graphics rendering settings. This suggests the student is either: * **Learning about APIs and how to interact with them.** The use of a testing client implies a practical exercise in making requests and interpreting responses. * **Debugging a software issue related to system information.** The detailed system information in the response suggests the student might be troubleshooting a problem where system specifics are relevant. * **Working on a project that requires system-level data.** The request indicates a need to obtain specific system details for use within a larger program or application. The code block in the response shows system parameters, indicating the type of system (Apple M1), operating system version, and several flags that are likely related to graphics and rendering capabilities. The student is likely analyzing this data for a specific reason related to their studies or project.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/372", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break down the key elements in a student-friendly way: * **The Request:** The student is making a POST request to `104.211.116.95:8080/api`. POST requests are used to send data to a server to create or update resources. The specific API endpoint `/api` suggests a general-purpose API. * **The Data (Body):** The request includes a JSON payload in the body: `{\"answer\": \"10687\"}`. This is the data being sent to the server. It seems the request might be part of a quiz or a test where the answer 10687 is being submitted. * **Form Data:** The \"form-data\" option is selected, indicating that the data is being sent in a key-value pair format, common for web forms. Here, \"question\" and \"file\" are keys associated with the request. The file uploaded is `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json`. * **The File:** A JSON file named `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json` is also being sent as part of the request, potentially containing more information needed by the API. * **The Response:** The server responded with a \"200 OK\" status code, which is a success code, indicating that the request was processed successfully. The response time (3.68 seconds) and size (143 bytes) are shown. * **Overall Context:** The image suggests the student is working on a project involving an API, possibly related to data analysis (\"Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights\" noted in the value column), and is testing the functionality of sending data to that API using a JSON payload and an additional file. The project might involve data cleaning or manipulation as indicated by the file name \"q-clean-up-sales-data\". In short, the student is likely learning about API interaction, data transmission in JSON format, and HTTP request methods. The 200 OK response suggests successful completion of the test API call. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/3/7394a5257884162f7de2da5edebfea971446cd0e.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a web application, likely for software development or API testing. The application displays a successful API call (indicated by \"200 OK\"). The request was a POST request to an API endpoint (\"/api\") and sent data in \"form-data\" format. The response includes system information, such as operating system version, CPU details, and memory usage, along with the status of various graphics and rendering features. The student has likely made a request to check the system's configuration. The JSON response details different aspects of the system's capabilities. The student is likely working on a project that needs this system information. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/b/9b64c8881a11f6110514f83dabb9e733f46865d9.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a tool, likely Postman or a similar API testing platform, to send a POST request to an API endpoint. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **API Request:** The student is making a POST request (a type of data transfer to a server) to the API located at `104.211.116.95:8080/api`. This is a common way to interact with web services. * **Request Body:** The request includes a `question` (text-based) and a `file` (presumably a JSON file named `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json`). The `form-data` method is selected, indicating that data is being sent as a multipart form. * **File Upload:** The `file` likely contains data used for the API request, suggesting a data processing or analysis task. * **Response:** The API responded with a `200 OK` status code, indicating success. The response time was 3.68 seconds, and the response size was 143 bytes. The response body (shown in JSON format) contains only an `answer` field with the value \"10887\", possibly the result of a computation or query. This result is straightforward and simple to understand, suggesting a successful test run and expected behavior. * **Context:** The project name suggests this relates to testing an API related to sales analytics at a company called GlobalRetail Insights (`Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights` in the request). The file name implies data cleaning or preprocessing steps (`q-clean-up-sales-data`). The project name \"TDS-Project2-Testing-Again\" and the \"q5-working\" segment indicate that this is part of a larger project, this specific request being a fifth or later stage and deemed successful. In short, the student is likely working on a project involving API interaction and data processing, testing their code or a system against a live endpoint, which produces a result they are currently examining and deemed successful. The screenshot documents a successful test run.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/380", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is developing a FastAPI application that uses the IMDb website's advanced search functionality to retrieve movie data. The code interacts with the IMDb website, likely scraping data, to fulfill user queries. The top section displays details about the API requests made, including the total number of requests and the IP address used. A recent query example is included, showing the planned interaction between the application and IMDb. The application uses a GET endpoint to retrieve data based on a query parameter. The bottom section reveals a critical error: the IMDb API is currently down or experiencing issues, preventing the application from functioning correctly. The alert clearly indicates the API's status and the last time it was checked. The IMDb logo is prominently displayed, reinforcing the API's intended source. The student will likely need to address this API outage before the application can function properly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/413", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_616784_0", "content": "@Saransh_Saini Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image 982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image 831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form. Thank you. Regards, Shivaditya [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/a/0aec52c2574797f9b3c56589104b77ef4c82bb6d_2_690x387.png [Caption] This image shows a log of HTTP requests and responses. It appears to be from a debugging tool, likely used by a student working on a web application. The log entries show the following information for each request: * **Timestamp:** The date and time of the request. * **Request Method:** The HTTP method used (GET, POST). * **Status Code:** The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 302 - Redirect, 307 - Temporary Redirect, 405 - Method Not Allowed). * **Response Size:** The size of the response in bytes (B). * **Response Time:** The time taken to process the request in milliseconds (ms). * **Client IP and Port:** The IP address and port number of the client making the request. * **Request Path:** The URL path requested. * **Client:** The client making the request (e.g., `python-reque`, `python-httpx`). * **Full URL:** The full URL the request was sent to, including the domain and path. The log shows a series of requests, many of which resulted in a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error, indicating that the client is trying to use a HTTP method (likely GET) that is not permitted for the specified URL. There are also several \"307 Temporary Redirect\" responses, suggesting that the requests are being redirected. This pattern suggests the student might be encountering problems with their application's routing or server configuration. The student may also be experimenting with different HTTP methods (`GET` vs `POST`) in the process of building or debugging their web application. The last request shows a successful `200` response, indicating a successful request. The relatively slow response time (509ms) compared to the others might be worth further investigation.

Specifically, it's for \"TDS Project 2\" due in January 2025. The form asks for two crucial pieces of information: 1. **GitHub Repository Link:** The student needs to provide the link to their GitHub repository containing the code for the project. The form provides an example of the expected format. The example provided uses the repository `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2`. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The student needs to submit the URL to their API endpoint. The form emphasizes that a POST request must be able to successfully interact with this exact URL. The example provided shows a link of the form `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`. The form also shows the student's email address, indicating that the submission has already been started or partially completed. The instructions mention the ability to correct the response after submission. The form is likely part of an online submission system for a course at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), as indicated by the email address format. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/a/0aec52c2574797f9b3c56589104b77ef4c82bb6d.png [Caption] This image shows a log of HTTP requests and responses. Each line represents a single request made to a server, likely as part of a software testing or debugging process. **Key Information for Students:** * **Timestamp:** The time each request was made. This shows the sequence of events. * **Method:** The type of HTTP request (GET, POST). GET requests retrieve data, POST requests send data to the server. * **Status Code:** The three-digit code indicating the server's response (e.g., 200 OK, 307 Temporary Redirect, 405 Method Not Allowed). These codes are crucial for understanding if the request succeeded or failed and why. * **Size:** The size of the response (in bytes). * **Time:** The time it took the server to process the request (in milliseconds). * **Source:** The software making the request (`python-reque...` or `python-httpx...` likely indicates a Python script). * **URL:** The specific endpoint on the server being accessed (`/api/` is a common API endpoint). Note the consistent server address, suggesting these are all requests to the same application. **What the Log Shows:** The log displays a pattern of requests to `/api/` on the server `tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app`. Many requests are GET requests resulting in a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error, indicating the client tried to use a method the server doesn't support for that endpoint. There are also several POST requests, some resulting in 307 Temporary Redirects (which are usually intermediate steps). A final successful POST request with status code 200 is seen at the very end, indicating a successful interaction. **Educational Value:** This log is useful for illustrating several concepts: * **HTTP methods:** GET and POST * **HTTP status codes:** The meaning of various status codes. * **API interaction:** How a client (software) interacts with a server API. * **Debugging:** The log helps pinpoint issues (like the repeated 405 errors) that need investigation and fixing in the client code or server configuration. The log provides a real-world example of how web applications interact and how to identify and troubleshoot problems. Students can analyze the pattern of requests and responses to understand the flow of information and potential errors.

Specifically, it's for \"TDS Project 2\" due in January 2025. The form requires students to submit: 1. **Their GitHub repository link:** This link should point to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for the project. An example is provided showing the correct format. 2. **Their API endpoint link:** This link should point to the student's deployed API endpoint. The instructions emphasize that a POST request should work with this URL. The form also displays the student's email address, which was automatically recorded upon initial form submission. The student is only permitted to submit one response, but can correct the response before final submission.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/422", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student might use this to debug a serverless function written in Python 3.12. Here's a breakdown relevant to a student: * **Function Invocation:** The function, located at `/main.py`, was triggered and resulted in a `Gateway Timeout` error (504). This means the function took too long to execute. * **Logs:** The logs show three events: * Two successful email-related actions (sending an email, updating an index.html file). * A failure to trigger a workflow, returning a 401 error (\"Bad credentials\"). This suggests the function was unable to authenticate with a third-party service (likely indicated by the `documentation_url`). * **Debugging Clues:** The student would focus on: * **Gateway Timeout:** Why did the function take longer than 10 seconds? This might be due to inefficient code, network issues, or resource limitations. * **401 Error:** The \"Bad credentials\" error points to an authentication problem. The student should double-check the API key, token, or credentials used to interact with the external service mentioned in the URL. * **Environment:** The function runs in a production environment. * **Resource Usage:** The function used 214 MB of memory out of a 1024 MB limit. This is not a significant factor in this specific error, but could become relevant if the function processed larger datasets. In summary, the image shows a common debugging scenario for a student working with serverless functions: a timeout and an authentication error. By examining the logs and understanding the error messages, the student can identify and correct the issues in their code. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/3/431749372121aa4f13d99382b7198b647d610060_2_690x291.png [Caption] This image shows a Vercel Function log detailing a failed workflow triggered by a function invocation. A student studying serverless functions, API calls, or debugging would find this image useful. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Vercel Function:** The code is running on the Vercel platform, a serverless function hosting service. This means the code runs only when triggered, rather than constantly. * **Function Invocation:** Something triggered the function (e.g., a user action, scheduled event, or another function). In this case, there was a `Gateway Timeout`. * **Logs:** The logs show a sequence of events: * An email ID was processed. * An email was updated in an `index.html` file (likely a web application). * **The critical error:** The function failed to trigger a workflow, returning a 401 error – \"Bad credentials.\" This means the function tried to authenticate with another service (indicated by the `documentation_url` pointing to GitHub's API docs) using incorrect login details. * **Error Details:** The 401 error message provides crucial debugging information: * `\"message\": \"Bad credentials\"` clearly indicates the authentication issue. * `\"documentation_url\"` points to GitHub's REST API documentation. The function likely makes requests to the GitHub API. * `\"status\": \"401\"` is the HTTP status code for unauthorized access. * **Runtime Environment:** The function is written in Python 3.12 and is running in a production environment. * **Performance Metrics:** The execution duration (10 seconds) and memory usage (214 MB) are also recorded. The gateway timeout suggests the function might take too long to respond. **Learning Points for Students:** * **Error Handling:** The log demonstrates the importance of proper error handling in code. The function should gracefully handle authentication failures instead of crashing. * **API Integration:** The failure showcases the challenges of integrating with external APIs, especially authentication. * **Debugging:** The log provides the information needed to debug the function – the specific error message, status code, and the API being called. * **Serverless Architectures:** The image illustrates the architecture of a serverless function, including triggers, responses, and logging. * **HTTP Status Codes:** The `401` status code should be familiar to students studying web development. In summary, this image provides a real-world example of a common problem in software development – API authentication failure – and illustrates how logs are used for debugging. A student can learn valuable lessons about error handling, API integration, and serverless functions from this screenshot.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/442", "type": "discourse_post"}

The use of `curl` suggests a familiarity with command-line tools. * **Google Sheets formulas:** The question focuses on understanding and applying the `SEQUENCE`, `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`, and `SUM` functions within Google Sheets, showcasing skills in spreadsheet software and formula manipulation. * **Problem-solving:** The student is using an external resource (the API) to verify their understanding of the formula and get immediate feedback. In a student context, this would likely be part of a computer science, data science, or spreadsheet-related course involving API usage and formula evaluation in a spreadsheet program. The exercise tests the student's ability to construct and interpret complex spreadsheet formulas and their understanding of how to interact with an API programmatically.

Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **POST Request:** The student is sending data to a server, rather than just retrieving data (which would be a GET request). This is common in creating or updating information on a website or application. * **URL:** The URL (partially obscured) indicates the target server the request is being sent to. * **Body:** The `JSON` data in the \"Body\" section shows the data being sent. In this case, it's a simple key-value pair: `\"answer\": \"140\"`. This suggests the student might be testing an API endpoint that expects this kind of input. * **Headers:** The \"Headers\" tab would contain information about the request, such as the content type (likely `application/json` given the body). * **Test Results:** The highlighted area shows the response from the server. `Status: 200 OK` indicates the request was successful. The `Time` and `Size` values provide information on how long the request took and the size of the response. * **Query Params:** The \"Query Params\" section is empty, meaning no additional data was sent as part of the URL. In short, the image depicts a student working on a programming or web development task that involves interacting with a server API. The successful 200 OK response suggests the student's code or request is working correctly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/445", "type": "discourse_post"}

The code uses the `requests` library to interact with a web API (`url`). It downloads a zip file (`q-unicode-data.zip`) containing three CSV and tab-separated files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, and UTF-16). The assignment's goal (stated within the code's `data` variable) is to process these files. Each file has 'symbol' and 'value' columns. The student needs to find the sum of all 'value' entries where the corresponding 'symbol' is either '<' or '$' across all three files. The code then sends a POST request to the API, presumably submitting the processed data. The response shows a status code 200 (success) and the answer `{\"answer\": 39961}`, indicating the sum of the values meeting the criteria is 39961.

This zip file contains three CSV/text files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, and UTF-16). 2. **Data Processing:** The assignment requires the student to process these files. Each file has two columns: \"symbol\" and \"value.\" 3. **Conditional Summation:** The core task is to find the sum of all \"value\" entries where the corresponding \"symbol\" is either \"<\", \"Š\", or \">\". This summation must be done across all three files. 4. **API Interaction:** The code uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to a specified API endpoint (`url`). It sends the downloaded zip file (`files`) and the assignment details (`data`) as part of the request. 5. **Result:** The code prints the status code (200, indicating success) and the API's response, which contains the final answer (39961, the sum of values).

The log also displays informational messages (\"INFO\") related to the application's startup and various import processes. The log entries provide detailed information, including timestamps, response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 307, 405), request methods, request sizes, response times, and client IP addresses. The use of `python-requests` and `python-httpx` suggests the application is written in Python. A student could use this log to debug problems with their deployed application. For example, the numerous 405 errors suggest a misconfiguration of the API or incorrect client requests, while the redirects could point to issues with routing or URL handling. The timestamps help to sequence events, making it easier to isolate the source of errors.

For a student context, it shows the activity of a deployed application (likely written in Python, given some of the log entries). Here's a breakdown for students: * **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** This is a cloud computing service provided by Google. Cloud Run is specifically a serverless platform; it automatically scales the application based on demand, meaning the student doesn't need to manage servers. * **`tlproject2hiva`:** This is likely the name of the student's project or application. * **Logs:** The main body of the screenshot shows a log of events for the application. Each line represents a single event, such as a request being handled or an error occurring. The information includes timestamps, response codes (like 200 OK or 500 Internal Server Error), and potentially details about the request. * **Importance for Students:** This view is crucial for debugging and monitoring. By examining the logs, a student can identify: * **Errors:** Errors in the code, causing unexpected behavior. * **Performance bottlenecks:** Slow response times indicated by high processing times. * **Successful requests:** To confirm the application works as intended. * **Resource usage:** How much of the cloud's resources the application is using. * **Example Log Entries (Interpreted):** The many lines show multiple requests hitting the student's app. The numbers (e.g., `200 OK`) likely indicate successful responses. The mention of \"python request\" clarifies the application's language. Other entries might indicate initialization, internal operations, or even errors if there were any. In short, this image demonstrates a key aspect of software development in a cloud environment: the ability to monitor and debug remotely deployed applications through detailed log files. A student learning about cloud computing, serverless applications, or even general debugging would find this image highly relevant.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/477", "type": "discourse_post"}

The script appears to analyze log data, likely from an API. The output indicates that the script identified five unique IP addresses that accessed the `/api/` endpoint. For each IP address, the script reports the number of times that endpoint was accessed. In a student context, this could illustrate several concepts: * **Data analysis:** The script performs basic data analysis by aggregating access logs to identify unique IP addresses and count API calls. * **Python programming:** The script demonstrates basic Python programming skills, potentially involving file I/O, data parsing, and aggregation. * **Networking:** The output involves IP addresses and API endpoints, demonstrating basic networking concepts. * **API usage:** The script analyzes usage of an API, showing how to track and analyze API calls. A student might be asked to: * Interpret the output and explain what it means. * Suggest improvements to the script (e.g., error handling, more detailed reporting). * Write a similar script to analyze different log data. * Explain the potential security implications of the data shown (e.g., identifying potential denial-of-service attacks).

The API endpoint is located at `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`. The student is likely working on a project that involves interacting with this API. The response from the server (indicated by \"Status: 200 OK\") contains HTML code that includes a script to load Swagger UI. Swagger UI is a tool used to visualize and interact with RESTful APIs. The script loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN (jsDelivr), and the JavaScript code initializes Swagger UI by providing settings such as the API specification URL (`/openapi.json`), the div element's ID (`#swagger-ui`), and the layout (`BaseLayout`). In short, the student is setting up their application to visually represent and interact with the API documentation using Swagger UI, likely for testing or development purposes. The screenshot captures the process of fetching and embedding the required client-side Javascript needed to achieve this. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/4/c4651dbc319b2d00ad1f0ea85e10c4c716b3ae25.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student's work in a cloud computing environment, likely as part of a course or project. The student is using Microsoft Azure and a virtual machine named `shashitdsproject2`. The main focus is the serial console, which displays a Linux terminal session. The terminal shows the student interacting with system services. Specifically, they've used commands like `systemctl` to manage the `uvicorn` service, which appears to be a web server. The output indicates that `uvicorn` is successfully running and enabled as a system service. There are also some warnings related to ffmpeg which the student might need to address. The student has also attempted to restart `nginx` (another common web server), but encountered an error (`command not found`) suggesting a potential issue with the system's configuration or PATH environment variable. The top portion shows the student is also working with a Python application, possibly related to the `uvicorn` service. There is code visible for an asynchronous function named `process_request` which suggests interaction with a web request handling framework (perhaps FastAPI, given the presence of a similar name in one of the browser tabs). Overall, the image demonstrates a student actively debugging and deploying a web application within a Linux environment hosted on Microsoft Azure. The presence of error messages and warnings indicates the work is in progress. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/b/ab704a5f91397ecaefad0c7b700fbf487e6a4e92.png [Caption] This image shows a student using Postman, a popular API development environment, to test an API endpoint. The student has made a POST request to a specific URL. The response from the server (Status: 200 OK) indicates success. The response includes HTML code that embeds the Swagger UI, a tool used to visualize and interact with APIs. The embedded Swagger UI is configured to fetch API specifications from `/openapi.json`. The lines of Javascript code show the setup for integrating Swagger UI into the webpage's HTML. This suggests the student is working on a project that involves interacting with an API and documenting it using Swagger. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/b/ab704a5f91397ecaefad0c7b700fbf487e6a4e92_2_690x457.png [Caption] This image shows a student using Postman, a popular API development environment, to test an API. The student has made a POST request to a specific URL (`shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`). The response (Status: 200 OK) includes JavaScript code that renders a Swagger UI. This Swagger UI is likely used for interactive exploration and testing of the API's functionality. The code snippet shows the embedding of the Swagger UI library from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js`) and initialization with specific configuration options (`url`, `dom_id`, and `layout`). The student is likely working on a project involving API integration or development, and is using Postman and Swagger UI as tools to facilitate this.

The student is likely working on a computer science or software engineering project. Specifically, the image displays a `curl` command used to send a POST request to a specific API endpoint. This request includes a question (about the number of successful GET requests to a specific webpage under certain conditions) and a file (`s-anand.net-May-2024.gz`). The API responds with a JSON object containing the answer (\"5082\") and several response headers (like content type and server information). The interface also shows the request URL, the response code (200, indicating success), the response body, and response headers. The \"Download\" button suggests the ability to download the response data. The overall context implies a practical application of API interaction, data retrieval, and possibly data analysis, which are common tasks within computer science and related fields. The student is likely testing or using this API as part of a larger program or assignment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/4/04546b4805d006ee2763bce3c3d8f1fb9f5eae1f_2_690x387.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work in a web application, likely for a programming or software development course. The student is using a tool to test an API endpoint. Specifically: * **API Testing:** The student is making a POST request to an API located at `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api/`. The request includes headers specifying the accepted content type and the content type of the request body. The request body itself seems to be asking for the number of successful GET requests made to specific pages under a certain path (`malayalammp3/`) between certain times on Saturdays. * **Response:** The server responded with a HTTP status code 200 (OK), indicating success. The response body is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair (`\"answer\": 5082`), likely the answer to the student's query. The response headers provide additional information about the response, such as the server software and the date and time. * **Tool:** The interface appears to be a web-based API testing tool, providing a way to execute requests, view responses, and examine details like response headers and status codes. It also offers a “download” function. In short, the image depicts a student successfully testing an API, a common task in software development and web programming education. The specific context of the API and the data suggests a project involving data analysis or perhaps a web server logging system. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/4/c4651dbc319b2d00ad1f0ea85e10c4c716b3ae25_2_690x387.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a project in a cloud computing environment, specifically Microsoft Azure. The student is using a serial console to interact with a virtual machine named \"shashitdsproject2.\" The console displays several important aspects: * **Code Execution:** The top portion shows Python code within a function intended to process a request, likely part of a web application. * **System Commands:** The majority of the console shows the student using Linux commands (using `sudo` for administrator privileges). These commands include: * Restarting Nginx (a web server). * Reloading systemd daemons (system services). * Starting and enabling a service named \"uvicorn,\" which is a popular ASGI server for Python web applications (like FastAPI). * **Service Status:** The output shows that the uvicorn service is running, its process ID, memory usage, and other metrics. The timestamps indicate recent activity. * **Logs:** The bottom section displays the logs generated by uvicorn, indicating the startup process and potential warnings about missing dependencies. In summary, the image depicts a student in a later stage of development, deploying and managing a web application. They are troubleshooting and making adjustments to ensure the application runs correctly on the Azure server. The presence of warnings in the logs suggests there may be further work required. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/8/a8f24f1e596a1ae98e2ac6e1a450aea01922a6b9_2_690x430.jpeg [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working with an API (Application Programming Interface). The student is likely learning about web development, specifically how to interact with a backend server using a request. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **The Request:** The student sent a POST request to a specific URL (`https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`). This request included a question asking for a GitHub Pages URL. The `-H` lines specify the headers of the request, and `-F` is the data being sent. * **The Response:** The server responded with a status code of `200`, indicating success. The `Response body` shows the server's answer: a GitHub Pages URL (`https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/`). The `Response headers` provide additional information about the response, such as security settings (`access-control-allow-credentials`, `access-control-allow-origin`). * **The Tool:** The student is using a tool (likely cURL or Postman) to make the API request and view the response. This is a common method for testing and interacting with APIs. * **The Learning Objective:** The student is likely learning about: * API requests (GET, POST, etc.) * HTTP status codes * HTTP headers * JSON data format (the response body is in JSON) * API testing and debugging In short, the image depicts a common scenario in a web development course where students learn how to interact with APIs to retrieve or send data to a server. The successful `200` response and the returned GitHub Pages URL suggest the API call was successful and the student's code is working correctly. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/7/c7f55da5f7b8a633a3011ceafacbe4431b176be5.png [Caption] This image shows a student using Postman, a popular API testing tool, to interact with a web API. The student has made a GET request to an API endpoint (`http://localhost:8000/api`) which appears to be linked to a Swagger UI. The response from the server includes an HTML snippet that embeds the Swagger UI JavaScript bundle. This bundle is used to render an interactive documentation page of the API, allowing users to explore the API endpoints, parameters, and responses. The student is likely working on a project that involves interacting with or documenting this API. The JavaScript code snippet shows how the Swagger UI is initialized, including specifying the URL for the API specification (`/openapi.json`) and the HTML element ID where it's displayed (`#swagger-ui`). The status code `200 OK` indicates a successful request. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/8/a8f24f1e596a1ae98e2ac6e1a450aea01922a6b9.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student using a web browser to test an API endpoint. The student is likely working on a project that involves interacting with a web service. Specifically, the image displays: * **An API request:** The student sent a `POST` request to a specific URL (`https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`) using the `curl` command-line tool. The request includes a question asking for a GitHub Pages URL. * **The API response:** The server responded with a status code of 200 (OK) and a JSON response containing the requested GitHub Pages URL (`https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/`). * **Response headers:** The response headers provide additional information about the response, such as the server used (`nginx`), the date and time, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings. In a student context, this could be part of: * **A web development project:** The student might be building a website or application that relies on data from an external API. This test confirms the API is working as expected. * **A computer science class:** The student might be learning about API interactions, HTTP requests, JSON data, or web services. The image documents a successful API call and its response. * **A software engineering project:** The student might be building and testing a backend service that responds to API requests. The overall image suggests the student successfully made an API call and received the expected data, indicating progress in their project. The download button suggests the ability to save the response data for later use.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/495", "type": "discourse_post"}

The log displays a series of HTTP requests received by a web server. Each line represents a single request, showing the IP address and port number of the client making the request, the type of request (GET or POST), the requested resource (usually a file path), the HTTP protocol version used, and the response code. Specifically, we see several \"404 Not Found\" responses. This means that the server could not locate the resource requested by the client. There are also some \"Invalid HTTP request received\" warnings, indicating that the server received requests it couldn't understand or process. One successful request is also logged with a \"200 OK\" response, indicating successful retrieval of the requested resource. In a student context, this image could be used to illustrate: * **Network protocols:** The log demonstrates HTTP requests and responses, showing the structure of a client-server interaction. * **HTTP status codes:** Students can learn the meaning of codes like 200 (OK) and 404 (Not Found). * **Web server operation:** The log shows the activity of a web server and how it handles requests. * **Error handling:** The \"Invalid HTTP request received\" warnings highlight the importance of properly formatted requests. * **Debugging:** The log could be used as an example of a debugging task, requiring students to analyse the errors and try to identify their causes. This log would be relevant in courses involving networking, web development, or system administration.

Let's break down what's happening for a student context: **The Code:** * **Line 1:** Imports the `requests` library, essential for making HTTP requests. * **Lines 3-4:** Defines the URL of a FastAPI server. This is likely a server set up for a class or assignment to handle requests. The specific IP address and port (`16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2`) will vary. * **Lines 6-9:** Creates a dictionary called `data` containing the \"question\" to be sent to the server. The question asks for an SQL query to calculate total sales of \"Gold\" tickets. The `r\"\"\" \"\"\"` indicates a raw string, allowing special characters in the question without needing escaping. * **Lines 10-11:** Defines a dictionary called `files` to upload a CSV file (`q-fastapi.csv`) to the server. The file path is specific to the student's computer. `\"rb\"` opens the file in read-binary mode. `\"text/plain\"` specifies the file type. * **Line 12:** Sends a POST request to the server using the `requests.post()` function. It includes the `url`, the `data` dictionary (the question), and the `files` dictionary (the CSV). * **Lines 14-16 (Output):** Shows the results of running the script. * `Status Code: 200`: Indicates the request was successful (HTTP status code for \"OK\"). * `Response JSON`: Shows the server's response which includes the generated SQL query: `SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`. This query is designed to process the data within the uploaded CSV. **In Simple Terms:** The student is building a system to query a database through a web API. They're sending a question (what's the total sales of \"Gold\" tickets?) and a CSV file containing the ticket data to a server. The server processes the question, uses the CSV, and returns an SQL query that answers the student's question. **Learning Objectives:** This code demonstrates several important concepts: * **HTTP requests:** Using the `requests` library to communicate with a web server. * **API interaction:** Sending data to a server and receiving a response. * **Data uploading:** Sending files as part of an API request. * **SQL query generation:** The server uses the user's request to produce an appropriate SQL query. * **Data analysis (implied):** The overall goal is data analysis and retrieval from a database. This is a great example of a practical application combining several programming and database concepts.

This is a crucial part, as it shows the location of the server that's handling the request. * **`data` dictionary:** This is the payload for the POST request. It contains a `question` key with a value representing a SQL query. This query aims to calculate the total sales from items with the ticket type \"Gold\". * **`files` dictionary:** This sends a CSV file (\"q-fastapi.csv\") to the server as part of the request. The file's location is explicitly mentioned. This is common in data analysis or machine learning tasks where data is input to the API. * **`requests.post(...)`:** Sends a POST request to the FastAPI server with the specified URL, data, and files. **The Server Response (lines 14-16):** * The console output displays the status code (200, indicating success), and the JSON response from the server. * The response contains a key-value pair `\"answer\"` with the actual SQL query generated by the server in response to the input. **In a Student Context:** This example demonstrates a common scenario in data science and programming courses where students might: * Learn how to interact with external APIs (like a FastAPI server). * Practice sending data (both formatted data and files) using HTTP POST requests. * Handle responses and process JSON data returned by a server. * Learn about request structures, status codes, and error handling in a web application context. * Understand how to integrate data analysis (here, using SQL) with a web service. The code is a clear example of how a program can query a server to perform a complex task (generating and executing an SQL query) without requiring the client (the Python script) to understand the internals of SQL database interactions. The server acts as an intermediary.

Let's break it down for a student: * **`@app.post(\"/tdsp2\")`**: This is a decorator in FastAPI. It defines an API endpoint that accepts POST requests to the URL `/tdsp2`. This means that when a client sends a POST request to this URL, the code within the function will be executed. * **`async def tdsp2(...)`**: This line defines an asynchronous function named `tdsp2`. The `async` keyword indicates that the function is designed to handle multiple requests concurrently, making it more efficient for a web server. * **`question: str = Form(...)`**: This defines a function parameter called `question`. It expects a string value (`str`). The `Form(...)` part specifies that this string data will be received as part of a form submission in the HTTP POST request. The `...` indicates that it accepts any string. * **`file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`**: This parameter is named `file` and accepts an optional uploaded file (`Optional[UploadFile]`). `UploadFile` is a FastAPI data type representing an uploaded file. `File(None)` sets a default value of `None` if no file is uploaded. In summary, this code defines a FastAPI endpoint that accepts POST requests. These requests can include a text `question` through a form and optionally an uploaded `file`. The function will likely process this data (e.g., store it in a database or perform some analysis). The `async` nature makes the API more scalable. The `/tdsp2` path suggests this endpoint might be specific to handling questions and potentially associated files, perhaps for a question-answering system or a data upload service.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/515", "type": "discourse_post"}

The form provides an example of the correct format for the link. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The student must provide the link to their API endpoint. It emphasizes the importance of providing the *exact* URL, as it will be used to send a POST request. This suggests the project involves an application with a backend API. The inclusion of a question about whether the form appears suspicious suggests a focus on security and awareness of potential phishing attempts.

The student is using a tool (likely a browser-based API testing environment) to send a POST request to a weather API endpoint (`https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`). The cURL command shows the request details, including the headers and the method. The server responds with a HTTP status code 200 (OK), indicating a successful request. The response body contains JSON data representing a weather forecast for several days, showing the date and a description of the weather conditions (e.g., \"Sunny and light winds,\" \"Thundery showers and a gentle breeze\"). The student can download the response. The instructions mention using the BBC Weather API, though the actual API used in the screenshot might be different. The assignment's goal is for the student to build a system to automate the fetching of weather data from an API.

The server evaluates this formula and returns the answer. * **The Tools:** The student is using a tool that simplifies the process of making API calls. It allows them to specify the HTTP method (POST), headers (like `accept` and `Content-Type`), and the data to send (the Google Sheets formula in this case, passed as the `question` parameter). The tool displays the generated `curl` command, which is a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. * **The API Call:** The API call uses the `curl` command to send a POST request to a specific Azure cloud-based API endpoint (`https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`). * **The Response:** The server responds with a JSON object containing the calculated answer (585). This demonstrates that the server correctly processed and calculated the result of the provided Google Sheets formula. * **Learning Objectives:** This exercise is likely designed to teach students about: * API interaction using `curl` (or a similar tool). * HTTP methods (POST in this case). * JSON data format for communication with APIs. * Google Sheets formulas and functions (specifically `SEQUENCE`, `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`, and `SUM`). In summary, this image captures a student's interaction with an API during a coding assignment that integrates Google Sheets functionality and checks understanding of both API calls and spreadsheet formulas.

The application presents a question: \"Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) `SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10))` what is the answer?\". The student is asked to input a formula into Google Sheets and submit the answer via a POST request using the curl command. The interface allows the student to: * **Input a question (string):** This is already pre-filled with the question regarding the Google Sheets formula. * **Upload a file (optional):** Although the question doesn't require file upload, the application offers this functionality. * **Execute:** This button sends the request to a server (the URL is visible in the `curl` command and the `Request URL` section). * **Clear:** This button clears the previous request and responses. * **View responses:** The interface shows the `curl` command used, the request URL, the server's response code (200, indicating success), and the response body containing the answer (\"695\"). * **Download:** A download button is present, though its exact function isn't clear from the image. Essentially, this is a coding exercise or assessment that integrates a practical Google Sheets formula with a web service interaction. The student needs to understand both formula syntax and how to use `curl` to make a POST request to a web API, demonstrating understanding of both spreadsheet software and basic web technologies.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/523", "type": "discourse_post"}

The form is requesting three key pieces of information: 1. **Work Email ID:** This section confirms the student's identity and indicates that only one submission per student is allowed. Students can correct their response before final submission. 2. **GitHub Repository Link (Project 2):** Students must provide a link to their GitHub repository containing the code for Project 2. The form provides guidance on the expected format of the link. 3. **API Endpoint Link:** This section requests the URL of the students' API endpoint. The form emphasizes that a POST request must be successfully sent to this specific URL. This implies the project involves creating and deploying an API. The overall context strongly suggests this is a submission form for a computer science or software engineering course, where students have developed a project involving coding and API deployment. The use of GitHub and API endpoints are consistent with such a project. The form's instructions highlight the importance of accuracy in providing the requested information.

The form requests two crucial pieces of information: 1. **GitHub Repository Link:** The student needs to provide the URL to their GitHub repository containing the code for \"Project 2.\" The form provides a sample URL format to help guide the student. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The student must supply the URL of their API endpoint. The form emphasizes the importance of providing the *exact* URL so that a POST request can be sent to it successfully. This suggests the project involves a backend component interacting with a frontend. The presence of a \"Does this form look suspicious?\" link implies a measure to prevent phishing attempts or fraudulent submissions. The \"7 of 134\" indicates this is one of many forms within a larger submission process. The overall context strongly suggests this form is part of a structured software development project assessment for students.

The form has two fields: 1. **Question:** A text box where the student types their question. 2. **Upload ZIP File (optional):** A file upload field where the student can optionally attach a zipped file, likely containing supporting documents or code related to their question. The \"Submit\" button sends the question and any attached file to the server. This type of form is commonly used in online learning platforms, help desks, or assignment submission systems to allow students to ask questions and provide context.

The email contains a Google Form requesting two links: 1. **GitHub Repository Link:** The form asks for a link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for \"Project 2.\" A sample format is provided to guide the student. The student has already entered their repository link. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The form asks for the link to the student's API endpoint. It emphasizes the importance of providing the exact URL to ensure that a POST request can be sent successfully. The student has already entered their API endpoint link. The bottom of the email includes a note about creating a Google Form and a query to report if the form appears suspicious. This suggests a structured submission process for the project, possibly with multiple parts, where this email is step 7 of 134.

It's likely part of an online assignment or question-and-answer system used by students. The webpage features a simple form with the following elements: * **Title:** \"Submit Your Question\" clearly indicates the purpose. * **Question Input Field:** A text box where students type their question. * **Optional File Upload:** A feature allowing students to upload a ZIP file, possibly containing supporting documents or code relevant to their question. The \"No file chosen\" text indicates no file has yet been selected. * **Submit Button:** A blue button to submit the question and any uploaded file. The overall design is clean and straightforward, making it user-friendly for students to quickly and easily ask their questions. The URL in the address bar suggests this is a backend API endpoint, meaning it is part of a larger system for handling student inquiries.

The student received a low score on a P2 evaluation and needs to make their server endpoint available for retesting. The email requests the student to: * **Turn on their server endpoint:** between 11:00 PM and 2:00 AM tonight. * **Leave it on only during that time:** The server can be turned off after 2:00 AM. * **Only the endpoint submitted through the official forms will be tested:** Endpoints submitted via other means (like discourse or email) will be ignored. * **If an updated endpoint was submitted in the most recent form, that one will be used; otherwise, the previously submitted endpoint will be used.** The email concludes by providing the specific endpoint URL that will be tested: `https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask`.

Because the student received a low score, the instructor is requiring them to re-run their server endpoint from 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM that night. Only the endpoint submitted through the official forms will be tested; endpoints submitted through other means (e.g., Discourse, email) will be ignored. If the student submitted an updated endpoint through the official form, that will be tested; otherwise, their previous submission will be used. The email provides a link (https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask) to the specific endpoint to be tested.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/595", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is being asked to provide two important links related to a project: 1. **GitHub Repository Link:** The instructor is requesting the link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for \"Project 2.\" A sample format is provided to ensure the student submits the link correctly. The student has provided their link: `https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final`. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The instructor is requesting the link to the student's API endpoint. The instruction specifies that a POST request should be able to be sent to this URL. The student has provided their link: `https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/` The bottom part of the screen mentions creating a Google Form and reporting if the form seems suspicious. This suggests the platform might also use Google Forms as part of the assignment or communication process. The \"99+\" notification suggests multiple messages are waiting for review.

The form requests two key pieces of information: 1. **GitHub Repository Link:** The instructor is asking for the link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for \"Project 2.\" This allows the instructor to review the student's code. The example link provided shows a typical GitHub URL structure. 2. **API Endpoint Link:** The instructor also wants the link to the student's API endpoint. The form emphasizes that a POST request should be able to be sent to this URL, indicating the API should be functional and accepting POST requests. This suggests the project involves a backend component with an API. The bottom of the form includes a standard disclaimer about reporting suspicious forms, which is typical of Google Forms. The \"99+\" likely indicates that many students have already submitted the form.

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **\"Ask a GA Question:\"** This is where you type your question. \"GA\" likely refers to a type of problem or a specific area of study, the exact meaning depending on the context of the website/tool. It could refer to \"Generative AI,\" in which case it asks for a question to be answered by an AI. Or it may refer to a different specific acronym. * **\"Type your question here...\"** This is the input field for the question itself. * **\"Upload File (Optional):\"** This allows you to upload a document (like a homework problem, data set, etc.) along with your question for additional context. * **\"Choose File No file chosen\"**: The button to select a file to upload. * **\"Submit\"**: This button sends your question and any uploaded file to the TDS GA Solver for processing. * **\"Response:\"** This is where the tool will display the answer or solution to your question. In short, the image depicts a simple, user-friendly interface for getting help with problems, likely using some form of automated assistance or a database of solutions.

{"id": "discourse_620347_0", "content": "* Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint Dear @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS : 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS : 1.1.1.1 , 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

{"id": "discourse_620453_0", "content": "Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 1000063856 1920×858 139 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/b/db761b4fc8a46e49b51c3b587e5d8a77402031f9.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a Windows PowerShell terminal displaying the results of a program or script. It appears to be testing or debugging a system that interacts with an API (Application Programming Interface). Key observations for a student: * **API interaction:** The repeated lines show the script sending requests (\"POST /api/\") to an API and receiving responses (status code \"200 OK\" indicates success). This demonstrates a common task in software development, interacting with external services. * **File processing:** The script processes multiple Python files (`.py`) located in a directory structure under `E://data science tool//`. This shows how code can be organized and modularized. * **Logging:** The log messages (e.g., \"tds_app - INFO - Logged IP...\") indicate the script is logging actions and the IP address making the requests. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring. * **Scoring and Confidence:** Some files' output includes \"score\" and \"confidence\" values. This suggests the system is performing some kind of evaluation or prediction, perhaps a machine learning or natural language processing task. * **Error Handling (implied):** The consistent structure and success codes suggest the script is handling errors gracefully. Although not explicitly shown, error handling is an essential part of robust code. In a student context, this image would be a great example to illustrate: * **API calls and HTTP status codes.** * **File I/O and directory structures.** * **Logging and debugging techniques.** * **Potential applications of machine learning or data science.** * **Software testing and verification.** The image likely represents a small segment of a larger project. It provides a concise glimpse into the practical aspects of software development and data processing. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/b/db761b4fc8a46e49b51c3b587e5d8a77402031f9_2_690x308.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a Windows PowerShell terminal displaying log entries from a data science project. The log shows multiple requests to different Python files (`.py`) located within a folder structure named \"data science tool\". Each request includes: * **The file accessed:** Indicating which Python script was run (e.g., `eighteenth.py`, `second.py`, `third.py`). These scripts likely perform different parts of the data analysis. * **The HTTP request:** Showing a `POST` request to `/api/`, suggesting interaction with a web service or API (likely for data retrieval or processing). A `200 OK` response code indicates successful requests. * **Timestamp and IP address:** Recording when the request was made and the source IP address (103.158.43.22), likely an external service or API. * **tds_app INFO:** This likely refers to a logging application or system named \"tds_app\" providing informational messages. * **Scores and confidence levels:** For some Python scripts (e.g., `second.py`, `third.py`), scores and confidence levels are displayed, indicating potential results from a machine learning model or a similar process. In a student context, this could be part of a: * **Data Science Project:** The student is running various scripts to process data, potentially using external APIs and machine learning techniques. The log provides a record of their execution and results. * **Web Application Development:** The student is developing a web application that interacts with a backend API. The logs illustrate the data flow and API calls. * **System Administration or Debugging:** The student is monitoring and troubleshooting the execution of their project. The logs are helpful for identifying errors or tracking the progress of their data processing pipeline. The image demonstrates practical application of programming, API interaction, and potentially machine learning, showcasing the steps involved in a larger data science or software engineering project.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/626", "type": "discourse_post"}

The form is designed to update URL endpoints. The top section explains the form's purpose: to streamline the process of updating endpoints and accommodate grievances. It notes that the user's email address (partially obscured but ending in `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) was recorded during previous submission. The main body requests the user to provide their updated endpoint. Importantly, it instructs users to *edit* the form if their endpoint changes, rather than submitting a new one, to avoid multiple submissions.

{"id": "discourse_620795_0", "content": "@carlton @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email. To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output. Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data? For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response. re-evaluvation-report 1636×1680 311 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-30 1938×934 130 KB Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-46 1948×940 136 KB Success 1922×940 132 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/2/12150aab1e4d0da5ede91f66240044926be1f004.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a tool (likely Postman or a similar API testing platform) to send a POST request to an API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`). The request is designed to submit a question and a file. The key observation is that the student is **intentionally sending the request without selecting the `file` parameter**. This is highlighted by the red annotation \"Sending req without file\". The API responds with a `400 Bad Request` error. The error message, clearly visible in the response (\"Missing question or file\"), confirms that the request failed because the required file was not included. The student's annotation, \"response same as evaluvation report\", suggests they're comparing this error response to a separate evaluation report, indicating that the API's behavior is consistent with expectations. In a student context, this image demonstrates: * **API testing:** The student is actively testing the API's functionality. * **Error handling:** They are observing and analyzing the API's response to an incomplete request, showing understanding of error codes and messages. * **Debugging:** The comparison to an evaluation report shows a systematic approach to identifying and resolving issues. * **Understanding of API parameters:** The student knows that the 'file' parameter is required and that omitting it leads to an error. This is a good example of a student engaging in practical, hands-on learning related to API interactions and problem-solving.

The student is attempting to submit a file (`abcd.zip`) for processing, but forgot to include a `question` parameter. The red arrows highlight key aspects: * **Sending request without Question:** The arrow points to the fact that the `question` checkbox in the request body is unchecked, indicating that no question was sent along with the file. * **Response same as evaluvation:** This arrow points to the API's response. The API returned a `400 Bad Request` error with the message `\"error\": \"Missing question or file\"`. This error message directly reflects that the request was missing the required question parameter. In a student context, this illustrates a common debugging scenario. The student made a mistake in constructing the API request, and the API's response clearly indicates the nature of the error, helping them learn about proper API request formatting and the importance of including all necessary parameters. The example demonstrates the practical application of API interaction and error handling in software development.

Let's break down the key elements: * **The Request (Top):** The student is sending a POST request to a specific API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`). The request body uses the `form-data` method, including two key-value pairs: * `question`: A text field containing a question (\"What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the...\"). * `file`: A file upload (`abcd.zip`). This suggests the API handles both text input and file uploads. * **The Expected Outcome (Right):** The student anticipates the API will return a `200 OK` status code (indicating success). This is explicitly labeled \"Expected res code\". Additionally, they expect a JSON response containing an \"answer\" key with a specific value (\"1234567890\"). This is marked \"Expected response\". * **The Results (Bottom Right):** The request was successfully sent. The API returned a `200 OK` status code as expected, along with the anticipated JSON response in the \"Test Results\" section which is visually confirmed. In summary, this screenshot documents a successful test of an API endpoint that accepts both text and file uploads, verifying that the API correctly processes the request and returns the expected JSON response with a 200 OK status code. The student is likely working on a project involving API testing, web development, or similar coursework. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/2/12150aab1e4d0da5ede91f66240044926be1f004_2_690x332.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a testing tool, likely for an API (Application Programming Interface). The student is sending a POST request to a server. The request includes a \"question\" but is missing the required \"file\". The top part of the image shows the request being built. The \"file\" checkbox is unchecked, indicating no file is being sent with the request. This is indicated by the red arrow and the text \"Sending req without file\". The bottom section displays the server's response. A `400 Bad Request` error is returned. The JSON response body shows an \"error\" message: `\"Missing question or file\"`. This error message matches the error reported in a separate evaluation report (not shown, but referenced in the image). This is indicated by the second red arrow and the text \"response same as evaluvation report\". In essence, the image demonstrates a debugging scenario where the student learns that their API request needs to include both a \"question\" and a \"file\" to be processed successfully. The error message from the server and the consistency with a separate evaluation report confirm the issue. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/5/f539896295f8754ffe827b53fdb38332d1b16f8f.png [Caption] This image shows a JSON representation of the results of five API calls. Each call tested a different code (\"test_code\" - likely identifying a specific question or file). All five calls failed (\"status\": \"FAILED\") with a HTTP 400 error, indicating a client-side error. The error message specifically states that the question or file is missing. In a student context, this could illustrate: * **API Testing:** The image demonstrates the process of testing an API and how errors are reported in a JSON format. Students can see how to interpret the `status` and `error` fields. * **Debugging:** The consistent error suggests a problem in the API request, possibly related to how the question or file is being submitted to the API. Students would learn about the importance of checking input data and handling errors. * **HTTP Status Codes:** The `HTTP 400` code is clearly displayed, teaching the meaning of this specific code and its relation to client-side problems. * **JSON Data Structures:** The image provides a good example of a JSON structure, which is frequently used to transmit data between servers and clients. Overall, the image is a useful learning tool for illustrating API interaction, debugging, and error handling in a real-world scenario, specifically within the context of a system evaluating questions or files.

The student is testing an API that appears to take both a question (text) and a file as input. The request body includes: * **`question`:** A text field containing the question \"What is the value in the 'answer' column of the...\". * **`file`:** A file upload field containing a file named `abcd.zip`. The student is expecting a `200 OK` response code (indicating success) from the server. The expected response in JSON format is shown below the test results which contains a key-value pair with the key `\"answer\"` and the value `\"1234567890\"`. The image demonstrates understanding of API interaction, HTTP requests, and JSON response formats, key concepts in computer science and software engineering. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/5/f539896295f8754ffe827b53fdb38332d1b16f8f_2_486x500.png [Caption] This image shows a JSON formatted log of API calls. Each block represents a test. The tests all share the same API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`), but different test codes (e.g., `GA1_q18`, `GA4_q6`). Every test resulted in failure (`status: \"FAILED\"`) with the error message \"HTTP 400: {\\\"error\\\":\\\"Missing question or file\\\"}\". This indicates a problem with the API requests; the server is returning a 400 error code because it's missing either the question or the file needed for processing. A student might see this during software testing or debugging, and it suggests they need to check their code to ensure it's correctly sending the necessary data with each API request. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/4/c4e8e2ee7ed548a59a61566b1d0d2b6c52b0bd4e.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a tool to send an HTTP POST request to an API. The student is attempting to send a file (`abcd.zip`) to the API. However, the \"question\" field is not checked. The key takeaway is that the API requires either a question or a file to be submitted. Because the student only submitted a file without a question, the API returned a \"400 Bad Request\" error with the message \"Missing question or file.\" This demonstrates the importance of carefully following API documentation and providing all necessary parameters. The error response mirrors the expected validation, confirming the API functions as designed.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/681", "type": "discourse_post"}

As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle POST requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data. Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle GET requests. However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 405 Method Not Allowed errors. These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines. Therefore, I request that the evaluation team only test using POST requests as originally instructed. Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be unfair and incorrect based on the project requirements. Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.

Both calls failed (\"status\": \"FAILED\") with a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" HTTP error. The error message indicates that the HTTP method used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) was not permitted for this specific URL. The \"test_code\" field likely identifies each test run (\"GA1_q18\" and \"GA4_q6\"). A student studying API interaction, HTTP status codes, or debugging would find this image relevant. The image demonstrates a common error encountered during API development or testing.

Both requests failed with a 405 HTTP status code, which means the HTTP method used (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) was not allowed for the specified URL. The `\"error\"` field in each JSON object provides more details. It contains HTML code that's likely rendered by the server to display the error message to the user. The message clearly states: \"The method is not allowed for the requested URL.\" For a student of computer science or web development, this would be an example of: * **HTTP Status Codes:** Understanding the meaning of HTTP 405. * **API Error Handling:** Learning how to interpret API responses, including error messages. * **JSON Data Format:** Recognizing and interpreting JSON data structures. * **Debugging Web Applications:** Analyzing the error message to identify and fix the problem in the client-side code making the API request (incorrect HTTP method being used). The API is correctly reporting the problem. The two requests differ only in the `\"test_code\"` field, suggesting that different test cases or scenarios might have been attempted, both resulting in the same \"Method Not Allowed\" error. The presence of \"GA1\" and \"GA4\" may suggest versioning or different test groups (e.g., Google Analytics 1 and 4).", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/682", "type": "discourse_post"}

They're sending a POST request to an API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`) with a question and a CSV file. The CSV file (`def.zip`), which is highlighted, is a crucial part of the test. It's described as containing a new CSV file *without any values*, only column headers. The student is likely testing how the API handles such a situation. The `Test Results` section shows the API's response: `\"error\": \"Answer column not found or empty.\"` This is the expected result (as indicated by the annotation), confirming that the API correctly identifies the absence of data in the \"answer\" column of the uploaded CSV. The test demonstrates that the API handles empty CSV data appropriately by returning an error message instead of crashing or producing unexpected results. The entire process is a test case designed to check the API's error handling functionality.

The `Test Results` section shows the API's response, which is a JSON object containing an error message: `\"Answer column not found or empty.\"`. This is expected behavior because the uploaded CSV lacked any data in the \"Answer\" column. The student is demonstrating an understanding of API interaction, file uploads, and error handling.

The student is performing a test where: 1. **Input:** They are sending a \"question\" (text) and a \"file\" (a zip file named `abcd.zip`). The zip file is crucial; the student specifically mentions updating this file with a new CSV file containing different values. This indicates the test focuses on how the API handles changes in the input data. 2. **Process:** The API receives the request, processes the data within the zip file (presumably a CSV file), and returns a JSON response. 3. **Output:** The API returns a JSON response containing the key \"answer\" and a specific value (\"3812934199\"). The student indicates that this is the expected result, confirming the test passed. The `200 OK` status code in the results section also confirms the success of the request. In summary, the image depicts a successful test case where the student verified the API's functionality by updating a data file and confirming the API produced the correct output based on this update. The test appears designed to validate how the API processes input data and generates corresponding results.

The student is sending a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`. The request includes a question and a zip file named `q-move-rename-files.zip`. The student intentionally modified the zip file to *not* contain any CSV files. The purpose of this test was to verify that the API returns the expected error response if a zip file without a CSV is submitted. The results show that the API returned a `400 Bad Request` with the message \"No CSV file found in zip.\", indicating the test was successful as it successfully triggered the error handling. The student's annotation \"Got the expected error response :)\" confirms this successful test result. The test demonstrates understanding of API testing and error handling.

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H “accept: application/json” \\ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\ -F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/686", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student in a computer science or software engineering class might see this during a debugging exercise or when learning about API interactions. Specifically: * **JSON Structure:** The response is formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common data-interchange format. It's a key-value pair structure enclosed in curly braces `{}`. * **API Endpoint:** `\"api\": \"https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/\"` indicates the URL of the API endpoint that was called. Vercel is a platform for deploying web applications, so this suggests the API is hosted there. * **Test Code:** `\"test_code\": \"GA1_q18\"` is likely an identifier for a specific test case or run. * **Error Status:** `\"status\": \"ERROR\"` clearly shows that the API call failed. * **Error Message:** `\"error\": \"near \\\"```sql...```\\\": syntax error\"` is the most important part. It indicates a syntax error in an SQL query (`SELECT SUM...`). The backticks likely represent code that was passed to the API, and the error message shows there's a problem with the syntax of that SQL query—the API probably tried to execute the SQL, which failed. A student would need to examine the SQL code within the error message to find and fix the syntax issue. In short, the image depicts a common scenario in software development where an API call returns an error, giving students valuable insight into debugging and API usage. The SQL error embedded in the JSON response adds a layer of complexity that students might encounter when working with database interactions and API integrations.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/687", "type": "discourse_post"}

It records a series of HTTP requests. The majority of these requests result in a \"404 Not Found\" error, indicating that the requested resource (web page, image, etc.) could not be located on the server. For students, this demonstrates several key concepts: * **HTTP Requests:** The log shows various HTTP requests, each including the IP address of the requesting client, the requested URL, and the HTTP version. The `GET` method is the most common, used to retrieve data from the server. `PRI 12A HTTP/2.0` indicates a request using the HTTP/2 protocol, likely for a connection upgrade. * **404 Error:** The frequent appearance of \"404 Not Found\" highlights a common web server error. This suggests problems with the server's configuration, incorrect URLs being used by clients, or potentially malicious attempts to access non-existent resources. It's a valuable illustration of a common error students may encounter in web development. * **Log Files:** The log file itself is a crucial tool for debugging and monitoring web servers. The log provides valuable data on client activity and potential server issues, allowing administrators to identify and address problems. * **IP Addresses:** The log entries include the IP addresses of the clients making the requests. This information is important for security and monitoring purposes and helps to identify the geographical location and possible origin of requests. * **HTTP Methods:** The presence of different HTTP methods, such as `GET` and `PRI`, demonstrates the range of actions a client can perform when interacting with a web server. * **Error Handling:** The log entries with \"Invalid HTTP request received\" point to instances where the server couldn't understand or process the client's request, possibly due to malformed requests or network problems. In summary, this image provides a practical example of a web server log file, demonstrating common HTTP requests, error codes, and the importance of log analysis in understanding server behavior and troubleshooting issues. It's a useful learning tool for students studying networking, web development, or system administration. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/9/e9a461b563e8ed65b91515d22c9999413e33b6f5.png [Caption] This image shows a log of HTTP requests, many of which resulted in \"404 Not Found\" errors. This is common in web server logs. The log entries show the IP address and port number of the client making the request, the HTTP method (mostly \"GET\"), the requested URL, the HTTP version, and the server's response. The \"404 Not Found\" indicates the server could not find the requested resource. There are also several \"Invalid HTTP request received\" warnings, indicating problems with the formatting or structure of some requests. For a student, this could illustrate: * **HTTP requests:** The basic structure of an HTTP request (method, URL, version). * **HTTP status codes:** The meaning of a 404 Not Found error. * **Web server logs:** How web servers record client activity. * **Error handling:** The importance of properly formatted HTTP requests and handling errors. * **Network troubleshooting:** The information contained in logs can help identify and resolve network issues. The numerous 404 errors might suggest a problem with the website's configuration or links, while the invalid requests point to potential client-side issues or malicious activity attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. Analyzing this log would be a valuable exercise in understanding web server operation and troubleshooting.

The API endpoint is designed to accept data in `multipart/form-data` format, allowing for both text data (a question in this case) and file uploads. Specifically, the example shows: * **The API Endpoint:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` This is where the request is sent. * **The Request Method:** `POST` indicating that the request is sending data to the server. * **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`, specifying the format of the data being sent (a combination of text and files). * **Data Parameters:** * `\"question=...\":` This sends the question as a text field. The full question is cut off in the image. * `\"file=@abcd.zip\"`: This uploads a file named `abcd.zip`. The `@` symbol indicates that it's a file upload. The overall context is likely from a student assignment or tutorial on API interaction, focusing on handling POST requests with file uploads. The student is probably tasked with understanding or implementing this type of API interaction. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/1/c1a8cba5ed8456711a70a4e5e5618fda747683fb_2_690x285.png [Caption] This image shows a code example for making a POST request to an API endpoint using the `curl` command. The context is for students learning about API interactions and file uploads. Specifically: * **API Endpoint:** The example uses a hypothetical API endpoint located at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. This is a common structure for deploying web applications. * **POST Request:** The code demonstrates how to send a POST request to this endpoint. POST requests are used to send data to the server, often for creating or updating resources. * **Multipart/form-data:** The request uses the `multipart/form-data` content type. This is crucial for sending files along with other data in the request. The `-F` flags in the curl command specify the form data. One part contains the question (\"Download and unzip file abcd.zip...\"), and the other part sends a file named `abcd.zip`. * **File Upload:** The `-F \"file=@abcd.zip\"` part shows how to upload a file (`abcd.zip`) as part of the POST request. The `@` symbol indicates that it's a file to be uploaded, not just a string of text. * **Question Parameter:** The request includes a parameter named `question` containing a prompt, likely for the API to process. In summary, the image is a practical example for students learning how to interact with APIs, specifically demonstrating how to construct a POST request including a file upload using the `curl` command-line tool. It illustrates key concepts of HTTP methods, content types, and file uploads in the context of API development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/698", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_621721_0", "content": "Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I’m guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock That’s LLMs for you! Can’t expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature. 1000040555 1080×1387 193 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/5/159a529cbb1380c77e2f446a56709c2f2c0f484f.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a JSON file, likely containing the results of a series of automated tests. Each object within the array represents a single test case. The `test_code` field identifies the specific test, while the `status` field indicates whether the test passed (\"PASSED\") or failed (\"ERROR\"). For the test case `GA1_q18`, the test failed, resulting in a syntax error in the SQL query. The erroneous SQL query is included in the `error` field. The other tests (`GA2_q3`, `GA3_q2`, `GA4_q6`, and `GA5_q7`) all passed successfully. In a student context, this could be used to illustrate: * **Automated Testing:** How software testing is automated and the results are structured. * **JSON Data Format:** How data is organized and represented using JSON. * **Error Handling:** The importance of clear error messages and the distinction between successful and failed test cases. * **SQL Syntax:** Identifying and correcting SQL syntax errors (the error in `GA1_q18`). This example highlights a syntax error, which is a common mistake for students learning SQL. The specific error could be analyzed to understand the incorrect SQL syntax. The file name `22f3001642.json` suggests a versioning or timestamp might be embedded in it. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/5/159a529cbb1380c77e2f446a56709c2f2c0f484f_2_291x375.jpeg [Caption] That image shows a JSON file containing the results of a series of automated tests, likely related to a computer science or database programming class. Let's break it down for a student: * **`22f3001642.json`:** This is the filename. The numbers likely represent a unique identifier for the test run. `.json` indicates it's a JavaScript Object Notation file – a common way to store structured data. * **The JSON Structure:** The file contains an array (`[]`) of objects (`{}`). Each object represents the result of a single test. * **`test_code`:** This field identifies the specific test that was run (e.g., `GA1_q18`, `GA2_q3`). The naming convention suggests \"GA\" might stand for \"Grade Assignment\" or a similar identifier, and the numbers might refer to specific questions or modules. * **`status`:** This field indicates whether the test passed or failed. \"PASSED\" means the test ran successfully, while \"ERROR\" means it encountered a problem. * **`error`:** This field (only present when `status` is \"ERROR\") provides details about the error. In this case, it shows a SQL query and the error message \"syntax error.\" This means the student's SQL code (the `SELECT` statement) contained a mistake that the database system couldn't understand. The backticks (`````) are likely used to highlight the SQL code within the JSON. **In a student context, this image suggests:** * The student was working on SQL queries as part of an assignment or project. * The `GA1_q18` test involved writing a SQL query to calculate total sales of \"gold\" tickets. * The student made a syntax error in their SQL query, causing the test to fail. * Tests `GA2_q3`, `GA3_q2`, `GA4_q6`, and `GA5_q7` were successful. * The JSON file is a common way to store and organize test results for automated grading or analysis. The student would need to examine their `SELECT` statement to identify and fix the syntax error to make the `GA1_q18` test pass. This could involve careful review of SQL syntax rules and the specific error message.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/706", "type": "discourse_post"}

The Python code defines a function `execute` that takes a question (string) and a parameter as input. It appears to be designed to retrieve information from a cache, which is a dictionary mapping email addresses to GitHub URLs. If the email address provided in the parameter is not found in the cache, the function returns an error message prompting the user to enter the URL. Otherwise, it returns the corresponding GitHub URL. The left-hand side shows the file structure within the student's repository, indicating other related Python files (Q21.py, Q22.py etc.). The top bar displays the GitHub URL, further indicating the project's location on GitHub. The image provides a snapshot of a student's work in progress on a programming assignment or project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/1/51eb6aa84b57bc9d3cfc1e19f341e86c85452318.png [Caption] This image shows a student's web browser displaying their university email address and a GitHub URL. The email address, `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, suggests the student is enrolled at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), likely in a program where 'ds' might indicate \"Data Science\" or a similar field. The year '23f' may indicate the academic year 2023, Fall semester. The `23f2004837` portion is probably a unique student ID. The GitHub URL, `https://23f2004837.github.io`, indicates the student has a personal website or repository hosted on GitHub, using the same ID as their email. The overall context suggests the student is using online resources for their studies and potentially showcasing their work publicly. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/1/51eb6aa84b57bc9d3cfc1e19f341e86c85452318_2_690x305.png [Caption] The image shows a webpage displaying a student's email address and a GitHub link. The email address, **23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**, suggests the student is affiliated with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), likely a first-year student based on the \"23f\" prefix in their ID, which commonly denotes the academic year. The GitHub link, `https://23f2004837.github.io`, further indicates the student's use of the platform for potentially sharing academic projects or code. The repetition of the email address on the page suggests a possible confirmation or verification process. In short, it's a common scene for a student managing their online academic identity and presence. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/c/dcb0ef9bdea43b2b852aa586c8c7230a70e783f0.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student's GitHub repository page displaying Python code. Specifically, it's part of a project called `GASolver` within a larger project by `TDS-Hackers`. The file being viewed is `Q23.py`. The Python code snippet defines a function `execute` that takes a question (string) and a parameter (likely a dictionary) as input. The function appears to attempt to retrieve information based on an email address provided within the parameter. It uses a dictionary called `cache` to store pre-fetched information. If the email address isn't in the cache, it instructs the user to enter a value. Otherwise, it retrieves information from the cache. The `cache` dictionary contains email addresses as keys and associated GitHub repository URLs as values. The context suggests a student is working on a program that might interact with multiple GitHub repositories based on user input (an email address), potentially for data retrieval or automation. The use of the cache indicates optimization to avoid repeated requests to the various GitHub pages. The code's structure and comments are relatively clear, demonstrating a basic understanding of Python programming concepts like functions, dictionaries, and conditional statements. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/7/77d9640fb9b880c88e9a584b9ede792c689fbe11_2_690x240.png [Caption] This image shows a student working on a web development project, likely involving GitHub Pages. The top section displays a prompt asking the student to input the correct GitHub Pages URL. The student has entered a URL (`https://23f2004837.github.io/`), which is being checked. The instructions mention adding `?v=1`, `?v=2` to the URL to clear the cache if there are discrepancies between the code and the live page. The bottom section shows the student's browser developer tools. Specifically, the \"Sources\" tab is open, displaying the code of a JavaScript file (`exam.js`). The code appears to be fetching data from the GitHub Pages URL entered above, and includes error handling (`catch` block) and potentially some logic for updating the page content based on the fetched data. The highlighted lines suggest this part of the code is responsible for retrieving and displaying information, potentially using a `querySelector` to update a specific element on the webpage. The presence of the `?v=1`, `?v=2` instruction in the prompt indicates this is to address caching issues, a common problem in web development. The overall context suggests a coding assignment or a debugging session related to a GitHub Pages website. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/2/42a64456808f873555ff4de31837f03230d11cc7.png [Caption] This image shows a student's browser's \"Elements\" panel displaying HTML code. The code creates a simple webpage: * **` ` tags:** These create a level 1 heading displaying the email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The email address is also repeated outside the heading tag, suggesting a possible error or debugging attempt. * **` ` tags:** These create a paragraph element. Inside, there's a commented-out piece of code (`== $0`). * **` ` tag:** This is an anchor tag, creating a clickable link. Importantly, the `href` attribute of this tag is set to `mailto:23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, which will open the user's default email client and pre-fill the recipient field with that email address when clicked. The email address is also displayed as the link text. In short, the code attempts to display an email address as a clickable link. The structure and repetition of the email address suggest that the student may be learning basic HTML and possibly making adjustments or correcting mistakes. The browser's developer tools are open, indicating a debugging process or code examination. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/7/4785d546f9503ff0afe19412b56481c7aa53398b.png [Caption] This image shows a multiple choice question and answer related to GitHub Pages. The question asks for the GitHub Pages URL. A sample format `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/` is provided, showing that a GitHub Pages URL includes the username ([USER]) and the repository name ([REPO]). The student has correctly identified the correct URL as `https://23f2004837.github.io/`. The \"Correct\" label confirms the student's answer is accurate. This is likely from an online coding course or quiz testing knowledge of deploying websites via GitHub Pages. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/7/77d9640fb9b880c88e9a584b9ede792c689fbe11.png [Caption] This image shows a student working on a web development project. The student is using a browser's developer tools, specifically the \"Sources\" tab, to debug JavaScript code. The top section shows a GitHub Pages URL being tested (`https://23f2004837.github.io/`). The student is likely trying to ensure their recently deployed website is correctly loading the updated content. The message about adding `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL suggests they are trying to bypass browser caching to force a reload of the latest version. The main part of the image shows the student's JavaScript code (`exam.js`). The highlighted section appears to be a function that fetches data from a URL (`https://23f2004837.github.io/`). The code includes error handling (`catch` block) and a conditional statement (`else`). The code's purpose is likely to retrieve data, potentially related to their website, and to display appropriate messages depending on success or failure. The use of `$(f)` and `$.toString()` hints at the use of a JavaScript library (likely jQuery or a similar library). The line `w.querySelector(\"invalid-feedback\").textContent = R;` suggests that error messages are displayed to the user within an element with the class \"invalid-feedback\". In short, the image captures a common scenario in web development: debugging and testing a website's functionality and ensuring that recent changes are reflected correctly. The code suggests the project uses a server-side component that is being checked through JavaScript. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/2/42a64456808f873555ff4de31837f03230d11cc7_2_690x236.png [Caption] This image shows a student's HTML code within a browser's developer tools (specifically the \"Elements\" tab). The code creates a simple webpage displaying an email address, `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, in two ways: 1. **As a heading (` ` tag):** The email address is displayed as a large heading. 2. **As a clickable link (` ` tag):** The email address is made into a clickable link, so that clicking it will open the user's default email client to compose a new message addressed to that email. The `mailto:` protocol is used to achieve this. The ` ` tag is used to create a paragraph, but it is empty (except for some seemingly extraneous characters `== $0`). This demonstrates a basic understanding of HTML structure and linking. The code is likely a simple exercise or a test to see if hyperlinking works as expected. The \"Elements\" tab indicates the user is inspecting and possibly modifying the HTML structure of a web page. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/7/4785d546f9503ff0afe19412b56481c7aa53398b_2_690x122.png [Caption] This image shows a multiple-choice question and answer related to web development. The question asks for the correct format of a GitHub Pages URL. The student is given a sample format showing placeholders for the username ([USER]) and repository name ([REPO]). The student then correctly fills in the answer box with a valid GitHub Pages URL, which is then marked \"Correct\". This demonstrates understanding of how GitHub Pages URLs are structured.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/710", "type": "discourse_post"}

The command starts a container in detached mode (`--rm` removes the container after it exits), sets an environment variable (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN`), and maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container (`-p 8000:8000`). The long hexadecimal string is likely a container ID or other identifier. * **`Started server process [1]`**: The Uvicorn server process has started inside the container. * **`Waiting for application startup.`**: The application within the container is initializing. * **`Application startup complete.`**: The application startup is finished. * **`Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`**: The Uvicorn server is now running and accessible at the specified address (meaning it's accessible from any network interface of the server on port 8000). * **`(Press CTRL+C to quit)`**: This tells the user how to stop the server. For a student, this demonstrates a common workflow in software development and deployment involving containers. It shows how to run a Python application (using Uvicorn) inside a container and expose it externally using port mapping. The use of environment variables (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`) suggests configuration flexibility and potential integration with other services.

Let's break down what that means in a student context: * **`podman`:** This is a command-line tool for running containers. Containers are a way to package up an application and its dependencies so it can run consistently across different environments (like your laptop, a server, or the cloud). Think of it like a virtual machine, but lighter and more efficient. * **`run`:** This is the podman subcommand to start a new container. * **`--rm`:** This flag tells podman to remove the container once it stops running. This helps keep your system clean. * **`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`:** This sets an environment variable inside the container. `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is likely an authentication token needed by the application running within the container. `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` means the value of this variable is being taken from the host system's environment. * **`-p 8000:8000`:** This maps port 8000 on the host machine (your computer) to port 8000 inside the container. This allows you to access the application running in the container from your web browser. * **`047fa151bf43`:** This is likely a container image ID or name. It specifies which pre-built application to run. * **`Started server process [1]`:** The container has successfully started. * **`Waiting for application startup.`:** The application inside the container is initializing. * **`Application startup complete.`:** The application is ready. * **`Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`:** This indicates that the web server Uvicorn is running and accessible at the address `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. `0.0.0.0` means it's listening on all network interfaces. CTRL+C will stop the container. In short, the student has successfully run a containerized application using `podman`. The application is a web application accessible via a web browser, and the output confirms its successful startup and running state. The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` suggests the application might require authentication.

For students working with Docker, this would be relevant for understanding image details. Specifically: * **TAG:** The image is tagged as `latest`, meaning it's the most recent version. * **Last pushed:** This indicates when the image was last updated (about a month ago). This is useful for knowing if you are using an up-to-date version. * **Digest:** A unique identifier for the image's content. This ensures you're pulling the exact intended image. * **OS/ARCH:** The image is built for a Linux system with an ARM64 architecture (common in mobile devices and some servers). * **Last pull:** The image was last pulled one day ago. This shows recent activity. * **Compressed size:** The image is 179.2 MB in size. This is important for understanding storage requirements. * **docker pull command:** This provides the command `docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest` to download the image. This is the crucial step for students to use the image in their projects. In a student context, this information would be useful for: * **Software deployment:** Learning how to pull and utilize Docker images. * **Version control:** Understanding how tags and digests relate to versioning and consistency. * **Resource management:** Knowing the size of the image helps in planning for storage capacity. * **Debugging:** If an issue arises, the digest helps in pinpointing the exact image used. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/b/0b6f4a9053f0f57c567c507af19f734eb316ca4d.png [Caption] This image shows information about a Docker image. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **TAG:** This shows the version of the Docker image. `latest` means it's the most recent version. * **Last pushed:** This indicates when the image was last updated on the repository. In this case, it was about a month ago by a user named `pradeepmondal`. * **Digest:** This is a unique fingerprint (hash) of the image's contents. It guarantees the integrity of the image. If you download an image with this digest, you know you're getting the exact same image. * **OS/ARCH:** This specifies the operating system and architecture the image is built for. `linux/arm64/v8` means it's for a 64-bit ARM-based Linux system (common in Raspberry Pi devices and some cloud environments). * **Last pull:** This shows when the image was last downloaded. In this example, it was 1 day ago. * **Compressed size:** The size of the image after compression, about 179.2 MB. * **`docker pull ...` command:** The box shows the command to download (pull) this specific Docker image. This is important to use when you want to download and run the image on your system. In summary, this image provides metadata about a Docker image, including its version, size, architecture, and download instructions, helping a user understand what it is and how to obtain it. The digest is particularly useful for ensuring that the image downloaded hasn't been tampered with.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/12", "type": "discourse_post"}

The test aimed to verify the correct extraction and storage of data. The top section indicates that a HTTP GET request successfully retrieved data (HTTP 200 OK) and saved it to a file named `b6.json`. The middle section highlights a discrepancy. The `EXPECTED` result is a list of author names. The `RESULT` shows the program's actual output, a JSON object containing an `author` array. While the array contains some of the expected authors, it's incomplete and doesn't match the expected order or complete list. The `\\u00e9` in \"Andr\\u00e9 Gide\" suggests a potential encoding issue. The bottom line, \"B6 FAILED\", confirms that the test case failed due to the mismatch between the expected and actual results. This indicates a bug in the web scraping program, either in the extraction process itself or in the JSON formatting. A student learning software testing would interpret this as an example of a failing test case that needs investigation and debugging to fix the underlying issue in the code.

The test aims to verify whether a program correctly retrieves and saves a list of authors' names. The `EXPECTED` section shows the list of authors the program *should* have retrieved. The `RESULT` section displays the data the program *actually* retrieved and saved to a JSON file (`/data/b6.json`). The test fails (indicated by \"B6 FAILED\") because, although the author names are the same, there's a difference in how the data is structured. The expected result is a simple list of strings, while the actual result is a JSON object with an \"author\" key containing the list of authors. This difference in structure caused the test to fail, indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the program. The HTTP status codes (200 OK) show that the HTTP request for the data was successful, but the program's processing of the data failed to match the expectation. The test highlights the importance of not only retrieving the correct data but also handling it according to the expected format.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/24", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_612358_0", "content": "can you please take a look at this screenshot? image 1451×640 64.9 KB The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. @carlton [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/b/fb3792e2a76ea8dd4cead0146f0366ceabc3dbb3.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a test (A7) that successfully passed. The test involved using an LLM (Large Language Model) to process an image of a credit card. Specifically: 1. **The Task:** The system was tasked with extracting the credit card number from the image file `/data/card.jpg` and writing it (without spaces) to a file named `/data/cc-number.txt`. 2. **HTTP Requests:** The test utilized HTTP POST and GET requests to communicate with a server (localhost:8001). The POST request sent the image to the server for processing by the LLM. The GET request retrieved the extracted credit card number from the output file. 3. **The Result:** The HTTP responses (200 OK) indicate that both the POST and GET requests were successful. The extracted credit card number (6011598665215965) is compared to an expected value. While the extracted number is very similar, there's a slight discrepancy, resulting in a test failure. There is an error in the last digit of the card number; the result is 60115986*56*215965 instead of the expected 60115986*65*215965. In short, the test demonstrates the functionality of an OCR system integrated with an LLM to extract data from images, but highlights the need for greater accuracy. The slight difference in the output suggests a minor error within the LLM or data processing. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/b/fb3792e2a76ea8dd4cead0146f0366ceabc3dbb3_2_690x304.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a test (A7) that successfully passed. The test involved a program that: 1. **Took an image of a credit card** (`/data/card.jpg`). 2. **Sent the image to a Large Language Model (LLM)** for processing. The LLM likely uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the card number from the image. 3. **Extracted the credit card number** from the image. 4. **Wrote the credit card number** (without spaces) to a text file (`/data/cc-number.txt`). The HTTP requests and responses show the communication between the program and a server (localhost:8001) managing these steps. The `POST` request initiates the image processing, and the `GET` request retrieves the extracted credit card number. Finally, the test verifies the accuracy of the extracted number. The `EXPECTED` value shows the correct card number. There's a slight discrepancy between the `EXPECTED` and `RESULT` in the last digit indicating a minor error in the OCR or data handling. However, the overall test is marked as \"PASSED\". This implies a tolerance for minor errors or a focus on the larger process's success. The test demonstrates the functionality of an image processing pipeline using an LLM to extract information from an image.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/26", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment involves several tasks related to web scraping and image manipulation. **Part 1: Web Scraping** The top section demonstrates a POST request to a local server (localhost:8278). This request sends a task description to extract author names from a website (quotes.toscrape.com) and save them to a JSON file named `data/b6.json`. The server successfully processes this request (HTTP 200 OK) and returns the extracted author names as an array of strings. The generated Python code, using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, is also shown, indicating how the task was accomplished. The next section shows a GET request retrieving the saved JSON data confirming success. **Part 2: Image Manipulation** The lower section shows a task involving downloading an image from a specified URL, resizing it, and saving it. This task (B7) failed. Another task (B8), likely involving string formatting related to the image manipulation, also failed due to incorrect argument conversion. The checkmarks and crosses indicate the success or failure of each task. In summary, the student successfully completed the web scraping task (B6), but failed in the image processing tasks (B7 and B8). The output provides valuable debugging information, showing the error messages associated with the failed tasks. This provides the instructor or the student themselves with clues as to where the code went wrong, potentially issues with image library usage or string formatting errors in the image resizing portion of the code.

The test involves two HTTP requests: 1. **POST Request:** This request sends data to a server (localhost:8278/zun) to extract author names from a website (quotes.toscrape.com) and save them to a JSON file (/data/b6.json). The test *passed*, indicated by the green checkmark. The accompanying code snippet shows the Python code used to accomplish this task, demonstrating skills in web scraping (using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`), JSON handling (`json`), and error handling (`try...except`). 2. **GET Request:** This request retrieves the JSON file created in the previous step. This test also *passed*, confirming the data was written correctly. 3. **Image Processing Task:** This task attempts to download an image, resize it, and save it. This test *failed* multiple times (indicated by red crosses), highlighting potential errors in the image processing part of the code. The error message \"not all arguments converted during string formatting\" suggests a problem with data type conversion or formatting within the image resizing function. In summary, the image depicts a typical scenario in software development where automated tests verify different aspects of a program's functionality. The results show successful web scraping and data handling but reveal issues in the image manipulation component. The code examples provide insight into the specific programming techniques involved, offering a valuable learning experience for students.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/27", "type": "discourse_post"}

The test aimed to verify the correct extraction and storage of data. The top section indicates that a HTTP GET request successfully retrieved data (HTTP 200 OK) and saved it to a file named `b6.json`. The middle section highlights a discrepancy. The `EXPECTED` result is a list of author names. The `RESULT` shows the program's actual output, a JSON object containing an `author` array. While the array contains some of the expected authors, it's incomplete and doesn't match the expected order or complete list. The `\\u00e9` in \"Andr\\u00e9 Gide\" suggests a potential encoding issue. The bottom line, \"B6 FAILED\", confirms that the test case failed due to the mismatch between the expected and actual results. This indicates a bug in the web scraping program, either in the extraction process itself or in the JSON formatting. A student learning software testing would interpret this as an example of a failing test case that needs investigation and debugging to fix the underlying issue in the code. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/f/4f1dd8069b7f12f5d9d2005215621bc73be9a345_2_690x276.png [Caption] This image shows the result of a test in a programming context, likely related to web scraping or data retrieval. The test aims to verify whether a program correctly retrieves and saves a list of authors' names. The `EXPECTED` section shows the list of authors the program *should* have retrieved. The `RESULT` section displays the data the program *actually* retrieved and saved to a JSON file (`/data/b6.json`). The test fails (indicated by \"B6 FAILED\") because, although the author names are the same, there's a difference in how the data is structured. The expected result is a simple list of strings, while the actual result is a JSON object with an \"author\" key containing the list of authors. This difference in structure caused the test to fail, indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the program. The HTTP status codes (200 OK) show that the HTTP request for the data was successful, but the program's processing of the data failed to match the expectation. The test highlights the importance of not only retrieving the correct data but also handling it according to the expected format. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c16494f34e29ae68a356211e09a264d5ba3f5846.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a student's programming assignment. The assignment involves several tasks related to web scraping and image manipulation. **Part 1: Web Scraping** The top section demonstrates a POST request to a local server (localhost:8278). This request sends a task description to extract author names from a website (quotes.toscrape.com) and save them to a JSON file named `data/b6.json`. The server successfully processes this request (HTTP 200 OK) and returns the extracted author names as an array of strings. The generated Python code, using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, is also shown, indicating how the task was accomplished. The next section shows a GET request retrieving the saved JSON data confirming success. **Part 2: Image Manipulation** The lower section shows a task involving downloading an image from a specified URL, resizing it, and saving it. This task (B7) failed. Another task (B8), likely involving string formatting related to the image manipulation, also failed due to incorrect argument conversion. The checkmarks and crosses indicate the success or failure of each task. In summary, the student successfully completed the web scraping task (B6), but failed in the image processing tasks (B7 and B8). The output provides valuable debugging information, showing the error messages associated with the failed tasks. This provides the instructor or the student themselves with clues as to where the code went wrong, potentially issues with image library usage or string formatting errors in the image resizing portion of the code. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/1/c16494f34e29ae68a356211e09a264d5ba3f5846_2_690x256.png [Caption] This image shows the results of an automated testing process, likely part of a software engineering or computer science class. The test involves two HTTP requests: 1. **POST Request:** This request sends data to a server (localhost:8278/zun) to extract author names from a website (quotes.toscrape.com) and save them to a JSON file (/data/b6.json). The test *passed*, indicated by the green checkmark. The accompanying code snippet shows the Python code used to accomplish this task, demonstrating skills in web scraping (using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`), JSON handling (`json`), and error handling (`try...except`). 2. **GET Request:** This request retrieves the JSON file created in the previous step. This test also *passed*, confirming the data was written correctly. 3. **Image Processing Task:** This task attempts to download an image, resize it, and save it. This test *failed* multiple times (indicated by red crosses), highlighting potential errors in the image processing part of the code. The error message \"not all arguments converted during string formatting\" suggests a problem with data type conversion or formatting within the image resizing function. In summary, the image depicts a typical scenario in software development where automated tests verify different aspects of a program's functionality. The results show successful web scraping and data handling but reveal issues in the image manipulation component. The code examples provide insight into the specific programming techniques involved, offering a valuable learning experience for students.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/33", "type": "discourse_post"}

The log displays several failed attempts at different tasks, indicated by red \"FAILED\" markers. The tasks involve: 1. **Reading files:** Attempts to read files named `mail-sender.txt` and `cc-number.txt` resulted in \"404 Not Found\" errors, suggesting the files are missing or inaccessible from the program's current directory. 2. **Image processing:** An attempt to process an image (`card.jpg`), extract a credit card number using an LLM, and save the result, ended with a \"500 Internal Server Error\". This points to a problem on the server-side, not necessarily a coding error in the student's program. 3. **Embeddings and similarity:** A successful task involving finding similar pairs of comments from a text file (`comments.txt`) using embeddings. This indicates that part of the assignment worked correctly. The log provides valuable debugging information, showing the HTTP requests made, the responses received, and which specific tasks failed. The student needs to address the file access issues (404 errors) and the server-side error (500 error) to complete the assignment successfully. The log's structure suggests it's likely generated automatically by a testing or evaluation framework, commonly used in programming courses.

The log details several tasks, each involving HTTP requests to a server (likely a local server at `localhost:8138`). These tasks are focused on different aspects of data processing, using an LLM (Large Language Model): * **Task 1:** Attempts to read an email address from a file (`/data/mail-sender.txt`), but fails due to a file not found error (HTTP 404). * **Task 2:** Attempts to process a credit card image (`/data/card.jpg`) using an LLM to extract the card number and write it to another file. This also fails, with both a 500 (Internal Server Error) and a 404 error. This suggests a problem either in the server processing the image or in accessing the intended output file. * **Task 3:** Uses an external embeddings service (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`) to process a list of comments, and then finds the most similar pair of comments. This step appears to have succeeded (HTTP 200 OK). The log indicates the failure of multiple steps, highlighting potential problems with file paths, server-side processing, and potentially issues with how the system interacts with the LLM. A student analyzing this log would need to diagnose the reasons for the errors and suggest solutions. The errors are labeled clearly (HTTP 500, HTTP 404, and explicit task failures), making debugging easier.

Specifically, it's a FastAPI application (`app.py`) that handles file reading and task execution. The code defines several functions: * **`start()`**: Likely an initialization function for the application. * **`read_file(path: str)`**: This function reads a file given a path. It includes error handling for missing files or files outside a designated \"data folder\". It returns the file content as a `PlainTextResponse`. * **`run_task(task: str)`**: This function appears to execute a task specified by a string. The implementation isn't shown in the screenshot. The right-hand panel shows a symbol table generated by the IDE, listing functions and constants used in the `app.py` file. The presence of `ai_proxy_url`, `ai_proxy_embeddings_url`, and `ai_proxy_api` suggests the application interacts with an AI service. The left-hand panel shows the project files, including a `Dockerfile` indicating it's designed for containerization. In short, the image depicts a student working on a Python web application that likely uses an AI service to perform tasks based on user input (file reading or task execution via specified paths/tasks), showcasing skills in web development, error handling, and potentially AI integration.

Specifically, it's a `KeyError`. For a student, here's a breakdown: * **`Traceback (most recent call last):`**: This line indicates the start of the error message and shows the order of function calls leading to the error. The most recent call is listed first. * **`File \"/app/app.py\", line 30, in `**: This shows the error occurred in the file `/app/app.py` on line 30. The ` ` indicates that the error happened within the main part of the script, not inside a specific function. * **`AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`**: This line of code is the culprit. It tries to get the value associated with the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` and assign it to the variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. `os.environ` is a dictionary-like object containing environment variables. * **`KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`**: This is the actual error. A `KeyError` happens when you try to access a key (in this case, `'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`) that doesn't exist in a dictionary. This means the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` is not set. * **`File \" \", line 716, in _getitem_`**: This line indicates where the `KeyError` originated within the Python `os` module itself. This isn't directly relevant to debugging the student's code, but shows the internal function that failed. **In simpler terms for a student:** Imagine a dictionary where you look up words by their meaning. The code tried to find a word (the environment variable) but that word wasn't in the dictionary (the environment variables). The code crashed because it couldn't find what it was looking for. **To fix this:** The student needs to ensure the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` is set correctly before running the script.

The student is attempting two tasks: 1. **Installing a dependency and running a script:** The first task involves installing the `uv` package (if needed) and running a Python script located on GitHub. This script is passed a specific email address as an argument. The attempt results in an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error). A subsequent attempt to read a file (`/data/format.md`) fails with a 404 (Not Found) error. This suggests a problem either with the script itself, the server running it, or the file's location.

The subsequent attempt to read the file also fails with a 404 error, mirroring the issue from the first task. The error is labeled `A2 FAILED`. The overall outcome is that both tasks fail. The 404 errors indicate that the file `/data/format.md` is not accessible by the script, while the 500 errors point to problems with the server-side execution of the tasks. A student debugging this would need to investigate the server configuration, the script's code, and verify the existence and accessibility of the `/data/format.md` file.

The application is designed to process tasks, in this case, a task named \"Say Hello Carlton\". This task uses a function called `extract_specific_text_using_llm` which appears to interact with a large language model (LLM) to extract text from an input file. The core problem is a `FileNotFoundError`. The application attempts to open a file named `system_input.txt`, but this file doesn't exist in the specified directory. This leads to a 500 Internal Server Error being returned to the client. The error is caught and re-raised multiple times, as indicated by the repeated \"During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred\" messages in the log. From a student perspective, this illustrates several important concepts: * **Exception Handling:** The log shows the importance of robust error handling in programming. While the application attempts to handle the `FileNotFoundError`, it doesn't completely recover and still returns a 500 error. Better error handling could provide a more informative message to the user or attempt to recover gracefully. * **File I/O:** The error highlights the critical role of properly specifying file paths and ensuring the existence of files before attempting to read from them. * **Debugging:** The traceback provides crucial information for debugging. It shows the exact line of code where the error originated, allowing a developer to pinpoint the problem and fix it. * **API Interactions:** The log shows an API call, suggesting the application is interacting with an external service (likely the LLM). Errors in this interaction can also cause problems, as seen with the 500 error. In summary, this image is a valuable example of a common programming error and the debugging process involved in identifying and resolving it. It emphasizes the need for careful file handling and effective exception handling techniques in application development. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/4/94b76c5b49a749a2750e840d06fef2715c0b0b69.png [Caption] This image shows a server log detailing a Python application error. A student studying computer science, particularly web development or software engineering, would find this useful. The log displays several levels of information: * **Server Startup:** The initial lines show the server starting successfully. * **Function Call:** The application attempts to call a function named `extract_specific_text_using_llm`, passing parameters including input and output file names (`system_input.txt` and `output.txt`). The function appears to process text using a large language model (LLM). * **Error:** A `FileNotFoundError` occurs because the file `system_input.txt` doesn't exist. This is a common error in programming where the code tries to access a file that isn't available. * **Exception Handling:** The application's error handling mechanism catches this initial error, but it also fails, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error (a standard HTTP status code indicating a server-side problem). * **Nested Tracebacks:** The log displays nested tracebacks showing the sequence of function calls that led to the error. Each traceback shows the file name, line number, and the specific error. This is crucial for debugging. * **LLM Interaction Details:** Before the error, the log provides details of the LLM interaction, including tokens used, costs, etc. This context indicates the application attempts to leverage an AI-based service. **Learning Points for a Student:** * **Error Handling:** The log demonstrates the importance of robust error handling. The initial error didn't stop the program but cascaded into a more significant failure. * **File I/O:** The core problem is a file not being found, highlighting the necessity of careful file path management in programming. * **Exception Tracebacks:** Understanding how to read and interpret tracebacks is critical for debugging. This log shows how to trace the error back to its root cause. * **HTTP Status Codes:** The 500 Internal Server Error is explained in the context of the application failure. * **LLM Integration:** The log details interaction with an LLM, illustrating the complexities of integrating external services into applications. In summary, this log provides a real-world example of debugging a Python application, demonstrating common errors, error handling techniques, and the use of external services like LLMs. A student can learn about troubleshooting, identifying the root cause of errors, and understanding the flow of execution within a program.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/54", "type": "discourse_post"}

Specifically, the student is: 1. **Pulling a Docker image:** The first command `docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` downloads a Docker image tagged as `v3` from a repository belonging to a user named `rohit23f1001156`. The `--platform arm64` specifies that the image should be built for an ARM64 architecture (common in phones and some servers). The output shows the download progress, including the image digest (a unique identifier). 2. **Listing Docker images:** The second command `docker images | grep \"rohit23f1001156/project1_tds\"` lists all Docker images on the system and filters the output to only show images from the same repository as above. The output shows the image tag (`v3`), its ID (`468630ef32b8`), when it was pulled (`5 weeks ago`), and its size (`581MB`). In summary, the student is managing a Docker image for a project (likely part of a coursework or assignment). The commands demonstrate basic Docker usage, showing the process of fetching and verifying the existence of a specific image version.

The file list shows several common files associated with a Python project: * **`app.py`**: This is likely the main application file. * **`datagen.py`**: Suggests a file for generating data for the application. * **`docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`**: Indicates the use of Docker for containerization, suggesting a more advanced project. * **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the project's dependencies (libraries used). * **`tasksA.py`**: Another Python file, possibly containing tasks or functions. * **`evaluate.py`**: Implies a file for evaluating or testing the application. * **Configuration files**: `.gitignore`, `pyvenv.cfg`, and `.dockerignore` manage version control (Git), virtual environments, and Docker configurations, respectively. `.env` likely holds environment variables. The presence of `pip` and `python` executables, as well as various Python files, confirms this is a Python project. The \"Python extension loading...\" message at the bottom indicates the IDE is loading required Python extensions for improved functionality. The \"PROBLEMS\" section on the right suggests there might be some issues or errors in the project. The command line at the bottom-right shows the user's current directory.

The files listed suggest a Python project using Docker for containerization. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **File Structure:** The left pane shows various files and folders. `.gitignore`, `pyvenv.cfg`, and `.dockerignore` are configuration files for Git (version control), virtual environments (Python), and Docker, respectively. `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `tasksA.py` are likely Python scripts containing the core application logic. `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are essential for defining and building Docker containers for the project. `requirements.txt` lists project dependencies. * **Python Environment:** The presence of `python.exe`, `pythonw.exe`, and multiple pip versions indicates a Python development environment. * **Docker:** The `docker-compose` files and `Dockerfile` strongly suggest the project uses Docker to manage dependencies and create reproducible deployment environments. * **Version Control:** The `.gitignore` file suggests the project is under version control using Git. This allows the student to track changes and collaborate on code. * **IDE:** The interface appears to be a code editor or IDE, like VS Code, PyCharm, or similar, with features like an outline view and a timeline. In short, the image depicts a student working on a moderately complex Python project, leveraging tools like Docker and Git for efficient development and deployment. The student seems to be familiar with using a command-line interface and employing common best practices for software development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/64", "type": "discourse_post"}

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Let's break down the different parts relevant to a student: * **TAG:** This indicates the version of the software. `latest` means it's the most recent version available. Think of this like a version number (e.g., v1.0, v2.0), but \"latest\" is a dynamic tag that always points to the newest release. * **Last pushed about 1 month by 23f2000599:** This tells us when the latest version was uploaded and who uploaded it (likely a username or ID). This is important for understanding how up-to-date the software is and who's responsible for its maintenance. * **Digest:** This is a cryptographic hash of the software's content. It's a unique fingerprint that verifies the integrity of the software. If this digest changes, it means the software itself has changed. This is crucial for ensuring that the software hasn't been tampered with. Think of it like a digital checksum. * **OS/ARCH:** This specifies the operating system and architecture the software is built for. `linux/amd64` means it's designed to run on a 64-bit Linux system. `amd64` refers to the x86-64 processor architecture, which is very common in computers today. This is important for ensuring compatibility with your system. In summary, this image provides crucial metadata about a software package, including its version, update date, integrity check (digest), and system compatibility. This is the kind of information a student working with software containers (like Docker) or managing software deployments would need to understand.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/86", "type": "discourse_post"}

It's essentially a detailed report of what happened when a program crashed. For a student, here's what it means: * **Traceback:** This is the \"breadcrumb trail\" of what the program was doing before it failed. Each line shows a function call, the file it's in, and the line number within that file. Reading from bottom to top shows the sequence of events. * **KeyError: 'USER_EMAIL':** This is the root cause of the error. The program tried to access an environment variable named \"USER_EMAIL\" (likely a configuration setting), but this variable wasn't defined or set. This is a very common error when dealing with configuration data. * **Import Statements:** Many lines refer to imports (e.g., `importlib`, `uvicorn`). These lines indicate the program was using external libraries/modules, which are pre-written collections of code. The failure might relate to how the program loaded and used these libraries. **In a student context:** This traceback could be shown as an example of debugging a Python program. The student would learn: * How to interpret a traceback to find the origin of an error. * The significance of environment variables in software configuration. * How to troubleshoot import issues, perhaps by checking if necessary packages are installed correctly. * The importance of proper error handling (the program could have included a `try...except` block to gracefully handle the missing `USER_EMAIL`). The traceback is very specific to a `uvicorn` server, indicating the program was likely a web application or API that failed to start due to missing configuration.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/103", "type": "discourse_post"}

The code encountered several errors. * **Database Error:** The top line shows an error message indicating the program couldn't open a database file (`\"error\": \"unable to open database file\"`). This suggests a problem with the file path, file permissions, or the database itself. * **HTTP 404 Error:** The next lines demonstrate an HTTP GET request to a local server (localhost:8000) to read a CSV file (`/data/b10.csv`). The server responded with a \"404 NOT FOUND\" error, meaning the file wasn't found at the specified location. This confirms the database error, likely because the data file was missing or incorrectly referenced. * **B10 Failed:** The \"B10 failed\" messages indicate a failure in a specific part of the code (possibly a function or module labeled \"B10\") directly related to reading the `/data/b10.csv` file. The failure is explicitly shown to be due to it not being able to read that file. * **Partial Success:** Despite these errors, a different part of the code succeeded. The final lines show a successful HTTP POST request to an external OpenAI API endpoint for embeddings. This suggests that the error is isolated to the data reading section of the code and not a complete program failure. * **Score:** A score of 12/20 is displayed, which indicates that the program partially worked but didn't completely fulfill the assignment requirements. The missing data file likely caused significant points to be deducted. In summary, the student's program failed to read a necessary data file (b10.csv), resulting in errors and a reduced score. However, other parts of the code (dealing with the OpenAI API) functioned correctly. The student needs to fix the file path, check the data file's existence, and ensure the file is accessible to their code to obtain a better score.

The log also shows that several of these requests resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error) responses. This indicates problems within the application itself. The traceback sections show that the errors originate from an `AttributeError`, specifically indicating a `NoneType` object lacks the `.lower()` method. This strongly suggests a variable is not being properly initialized or assigned a value within the application's `run_task` function. The initial warning message at the top clearly states the server is running in debug mode and shouldn't be used in a production environment because of its inherent security vulnerabilities. The student should understand the importance of this warning and the need to switch to a production-ready WSGI server for deploying the application. The log demonstrates several key concepts, including HTTP requests, server-side errors, debugging, and traceback analysis, all relevant to web application development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/110", "type": "discourse_post"}

For a student, this could represent several things: * **A function list for a project:** Each line `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, etc., suggests a separate function designed to handle a specific task within a larger program. For example, `a8_credit_card_image()` might be a function to process and display credit card images, while `a3_dates()` might handle date formatting or calculations. This is common in larger programming projects where code is broken down into modular functions. * **An outline/pseudocode:** Before actually writing the code, a student might create a list like this to plan the structure of their program. Each function represents a step or module in the overall project. * **Part of a documentation example:** The image might be a snippet from program documentation showing available functions and their names, to help other programmers understand how to use the code. * **An exercise in function definition:** The list could be part of an assignment where students are tasked with creating each function according to its description implied by the name. This would teach them about function definition, modularity, and code organization. In summary, the image depicts a structured list of functions, common in programming. The context for a student would likely involve planning, designing, or implementing a larger program or completing a programming assignment.

Specifically, it displays two traceback error messages, both resulting in an `OSError: cannot open resource`. The error originates within a function (`a8_credit_card_image`) in a file named `datagenmrt9km.py`. The code attempts to load TrueType fonts using the PIL (Pillow) library. The tracebacks show the code tried loading \"arial.ttf\" and then \"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf\" but failed in both attempts because the system cannot find the font files, resulting in the \"cannot open resource\" error. The error messages pinpoint the exact lines of code in `ImageFont.py` (a part of the PIL library) where the problem occurs, which are in functions related to font loading and initialization. The final INFO line seems unrelated, showing a network request perhaps from a larger application or script where this error occurred. A student should understand that this points to a file path issue; the specified font files are not located where the program expects them to be.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/114", "type": "discourse_post"}

The errors indicate problems: * **Internal Server Error (500):** The local server returned a 500 error. This means there's a problem on the server-side, possibly a bug in the server code or a lack of resources. * **Too Many Requests (429):** The API call to `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` resulted in a 429 error, indicating the student has exceeded the allowed number of requests to the AI API within a given time frame. This is a common issue when using free or limited-access API services. In summary, the image depicts a common scenario faced by students working on projects involving external APIs and custom scripts: the task appears to be working locally but then fails because of exceeding request limits to a remote AI service. The student likely needs to either wait, find an alternative API, or investigate the reasons for the server-side (500) error.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/115", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student's Project 1 submission failed to meet the prerequisites. The evaluation checked five criteria related to a GitHub repository and a Docker image: 1. **Repository Existence and Public Accessibility:** PASS - The student's GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible. 2. **MIT License:** FAIL - The repository lacks a LICENSE file with the MIT license. 3. **Dockerfile:** FAIL - The repository is missing a valid `Dockerfile`. 4. **Docker Image Public Accessibility:** PASS - The Docker image is publicly accessible. 5. **Dockerfile Consistency:** This check is not explicitly reported, but it's implied to have passed or failed based on the results of the Dockerfile check. Because the student failed to meet the minimum requirements (items 2 and 3 failed), their project submission received a score of 0 and will not be evaluated further. The evaluation clearly lists the failing elements and a summary showing an overall project failure. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/c/2c922cdf1470207949392f3402b7cea1989e2397.jpeg [Caption] This image shows the results of a pre-submission check for Project 1. The student's project failed because it did not meet several requirements: * **GitHub Repository Issues:** The GitHub repository was not publicly accessible, lacked a LICENSE file with the MIT license, and did not contain a valid Dockerfile in the root directory. * **Docker Image Issues:** While the Docker image itself was present and public, it did not use the same Dockerfile as the one in the student's GitHub repository. The evaluation clearly states that failure to meet these minimum requirements results in the project not being evaluated. The student received a score of 0. The student needs to address the identified problems in their GitHub repository and Docker image before resubmission. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/8/c8edbd63c9ebf7c97ccc221d7c91fa9ee4c8554c_2_690x439.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's view of a Git repository, likely on a platform like GitHub or GitLab. The repository is named \"tds_proj1,\" suggesting it's a project for a course or assignment. The main branch shows several files and folders, indicating a structured project: * **Folders:** `_pycache_`, `data`, `env` – these likely contain cached Python files, project data, and a virtual environment, respectively. * **Files:** `Dockerfile` (for containerization), `LICENSE` (project license), `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt` (listing project dependencies), and `tasksA.py` – these strongly suggest a Python-based project, possibly involving data generation, evaluation, and some tasks (A). The \"update\" next to each file signifies recent changes committed to the repository, all within the last two months. The commit history (10 commits total, shown at the top right) confirms recent activity on the project. This suggests the student has been actively working on and updating the project over time. The commit history's hash (`5e4785c`) and date indicate the most recent update. Overall, it's a snapshot of a student's in-progress software project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/8/c8edbd63c9ebf7c97ccc221d7c91fa9ee4c8554c.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a Git repository's file structure and commit history on a platform like GitHub or GitLab. A student in a software development or data science course would recognize this as a view of a project's files and recent changes. Specifically: * **`tds_proj1`:** This is likely the name of the project. * **`main` branch:** The project is currently viewing the `main` branch (the primary development branch). * **Commit History:** The list shows ten recent commits, all made within the last two months, mostly labeled \"update.\" This suggests ongoing development and iterative changes. * **File Structure:** The project has a clearly defined structure with folders for data (`data`), a virtual environment (`env`), and files with Python extensions (`.py`). The presence of a `Dockerfile` suggests containerization is used, indicating a more advanced setup. `requirements.txt` lists project dependencies. * **`_pycache_`:** This is a standard Python folder containing compiled bytecode. * **`LICENSE`:** The presence of a LICENSE file indicates that the project has an open-source license. In the context of a student's learning, this could represent several things: * **Version Control:** The image demonstrates a proper usage of Git for managing code changes. Students learn this as a crucial part of software development. * **Project Organization:** It showcases good coding practices through a well-organized project structure. * **Collaboration:** The history suggests multiple commits, indicating potential teamwork and collaborative development. * **Software Development Lifecycle:** The iterative nature (\"update\" commits) reflects the typical software development lifecycle. Overall, the image serves as a visual representation of a student's project that is well-maintained and developed using standard software engineering practices.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/142", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment likely involves using a tool called `datasette` to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`) and save the results to a file. The log shows several failed attempts: * **HTTP 404 Not Found errors:** These indicate the student's code tried to access files (`b9.html`, `b10.csv`) that the server couldn't find. This suggests issues with file paths or the server's configuration. * **HTTP 400 Bad Request error:** This signifies that the server understood the request but couldn't process it due to an issue in the request itself (likely in the way the database query was formatted or transmitted). The specific error message points to a connection problem, possibly due to the server being down or having insufficient resources. * **Connection Refused error (Errno 111):** This is a clear indicator that the database server (`localhost:8001`) wasn't reachable or was actively rejecting connections, which could be a network or firewall issue. The student's code attempted to run `datasette` in the background using the `uvx` tool. However, the connection issues prevented the task from completing successfully, resulting in a low score (6/20). The final successful `POST` request to `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` is likely unrelated to the main part of the assignment (potentially a separate submission to an API). In summary, the image highlights common problems faced when working with web servers, databases, and APIs. The main issue lies in network connectivity and server configuration, preventing successful database queries and file access. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/b/db1247df1beef8d4878a7ab13e5ad4eb7e626868_2_246x500.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's debugging log from a programming assignment. The goal was to use a Dataset server to count rows in a database where the 'type' column equals \"Bronze\" and save the result. The log demonstrates several failed attempts: * **HTTP 404 Errors:** The student repeatedly receives \"404 Not Found\" errors when trying to access files (`b9.html`, `b10.csv`) This suggests issues with file paths or the server not correctly serving these files. * **HTTP 400 Error:** A \"400 Bad Request\" error indicates a problem with the request sent to the server. The detailed error message points to a connection issue: `Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv` indicating the server couldn't connect to the database to execute the SQL query. The root cause is \"Connection refused\" implying a problem with the database server itself (perhaps not running or incorrect connection details). * **Failed Tasks:** The `89 FAILED` and `B10 FAILED` entries clearly show the task to read the files failed. * **Score:** The low score of 6/20 reflects the unsuccessful execution of the main parts of the assignment. * **Successful API Call:** The final entry showing a `200 OK` response from a POST request to an embedding service (possibly for a separate part of the assignment, or a debugging tool) is irrelevant to the core problem. In summary, the image illustrates a common debugging scenario for students: errors related to file paths, database connections, and server-side issues. The student likely needs to check: * **Database server status:** Is it running correctly? Are the connection details (hostname, port, database name) correct? * **File paths:** Double-check the paths specified in both the code and the server configuration. * **Server configuration:** Ensure the server is correctly configured to serve the intended files and handle requests. * **SQL query:** Verify the correctness of the SQL statement used. The errors are indicative of a problem connecting to or retrieving data from the local database, not a problem with the final API call.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/143", "type": "discourse_post"}

This suggests that either the file was not created correctly, or the file path is wrong. This failure is indicated by the \"B10 failed\" and \"B10 FAILED\" messages. **Additional context:** The bottom of the image shows a successful POST request to an embeddings API (likely unrelated to the main task), suggesting the student's overall environment appears to be functioning correctly (excluding the failure related to the saved CSV). The score of 10/20 is potentially a reflection of the incomplete or failed result from the main Datasette/SQL portion of the assignment. The notes emphasize ensuring the necessary software is installed and that the `/data` directory has appropriate write permissions. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/7/f7ff60d992c45e083570f274407f2914b3f3f4c3.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's debugging log while working on a programming assignment. The assignment likely involves using a datasette server to process data and interact with an external API (possibly OpenAI). The log displays several HTTP requests and their responses. Key observations include: * **Datasette Server Issues:** The student attempts to POST data to a local datasette server (localhost:8462 and localhost:8064), but encounters a 500 Internal Server Error and a 404 Not Found error. This suggests problems with the server's configuration or the data file path (`/data/b10.csv`). The GET request confirms the server cannot find the specified CSV file. * **OpenAI API Limit:** A POST request to the OpenAI API (likely for embeddings) fails due to a 429 Too Many Requests error, indicating the student has exceeded the API's usage limit. * **Script Installation:** A task to install the `uv` package and run a Python script (`datagen.py`) from a GitHub Gist is also shown. This script is likely part of the data generation or processing pipeline. * **Overall Failure:** The student receives a low score (1/20), clearly demonstrating that the assignment is not working correctly. The errors suggest a combination of server-side issues and exceeding API limits. The student needs to troubleshoot their datasette server, verify the data file path, and manage their OpenAI API usage. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/7/f7ff60d992c45e083570f274407f2914b3f3f4c3_2_230x500.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's terminal output, likely from a Jupyter Notebook or similar environment, detailing a programming assignment or project. The student is encountering several errors while attempting to complete a task. Here's a breakdown for a student audience: * **The Goal:** The initial instructions seem to involve retrieving data from a \"datasette server,\" processing it (possibly counting rows matching specific criteria), saving it to a file (`/data/b10.csv`), and then using that data in further steps. A later step involves using an external API (OpenAI) likely for natural language processing or embedding generation. * **The Errors:** The output displays multiple errors: * **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error):** This indicates a problem with the datasette server itself, preventing the initial data retrieval. The server may be overloaded or have a bug. * **HTTP 404 (Not Found):** This means the server couldn't find the file `/data/b10.csv` after attempting to create it. This suggests the previous step (saving the data) failed. * **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests):** This is a common error from APIs like OpenAI's. It means the student has exceeded their request limit, likely due to repeatedly retrying failed requests or an inefficient code structure. They need to wait or adjust their code to make fewer requests. * **The Code (partially visible):** Snippets of code are visible, showing HTTP requests (using the POST and GET methods) interacting with servers and APIs. There's also a command to install a dependency ('uv'), implying the code relies on a package for handling this. * **The Score:** The score of \"1/20\" clearly indicates the student's assignment is not working correctly. In summary, the image shows a student debugging a programming assignment, facing server-side issues, API rate limits, and file access problems. They need to troubleshoot the datasette server, potentially revise their data handling logic, and address their API request rate to successfully complete the task. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/0/c0842e4115f2f72cc643b6b066c8c503b592c608_2_230x500.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's work involving a Datasette server and SQL queries. The student is following a multi-step process: 1. **Starting the server:** They initiated a Datasette server using a command line interface. 2. **Running a SQL query:** They used `curl` (a command-line tool) to execute a SQL query against the server's database (`ticket-sales.csv`). The query counts the number of rows where the 'type' column equals 'bronze'. The results are saved to a local file `/data/b10.csv`. This step failed, producing an error. 3. **Stopping the server:** Instructions are given on how to stop the server gracefully using either `fg` (foreground) or `kill` (terminate) commands, depending on the server's process state. The bottom of the image shows the results of the student's attempt. The `HTTP Request: GET` shows that an attempt to access the supposedly created `/data/b10.csv` file via HTTP resulted in a \"404 Not Found\" error. The subsequent lines, \"B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv\" and \"B10 FAILED,\" clearly indicate that the process to create and save the file to the specified directory failed. A final successful HTTP POST request to a different API (likely unrelated to the initial task) is shown at the very end, suggesting the student moved on to another part of their assignment. The score of \"10/20\" suggests that this part of the assignment was only partially successful, likely due to the failure of the `curl` command and subsequent inability to read the expected output file. The reason for the failure is not explicitly stated but is likely related to file permissions, path issues, or the server not running correctly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/157", "type": "discourse_post"}

It specifically displays information about a repository named \"data_automation_agent\". Here's a breakdown for a student: * **Repository:** This is a central location where code, files, and other assets for a software project are stored and managed. Think of it as a folder for a large project, but with version control and collaboration features. * **Tags:** These are labels used to identify specific versions or points in the repository's history. The image shows a single tag called \"latest\", which suggests this is the most recent version. The tag is associated with an image (likely a container image, like a Docker image). This image is of the OS type. * **OS:** This column indicates the operating system the image is built for (in this case, represented by the penguin icon, which is a common symbol for Linux). * **Pulled/Pushed:** \"Pulled\" indicates when someone downloaded a copy of the image. \"Pushed\" shows when the image was uploaded to the repository. The time stamps show the image was recently pulled but pushed about a month ago. * **Repository Size:** Shows the repository's total size (757 MB). * **Last Pushed:** Indicates the last time updates were added to the repository. In essence, this screenshot shows that the repository contains a single image tagged as \"latest\", built for Linux, and was recently downloaded, but the latest upload was about a month ago. This is a common way to manage software and deploy applications using containerization techniques.

The repository is named \"23f2004644/data_automation_agent\" and contains a single image tag labeled \"latest\". Key information includes: * **Repository Size:** 757 MB. This indicates the size of the image stored within the repository. * **Last Pushed:** About a month ago. This shows when the most recent version of the image was uploaded. * **Last Pulled:** 5 days ago. This indicates when the image was last downloaded for use. * **Image Type:** The tag \"latest\" is of type \"Image\", indicating it's a container image. The Linux penguin icon suggests this image is likely based on a Linux distribution. For students, this would be relevant in contexts involving: * **Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes):** The image is clearly a container image, highlighting concepts related to building, deploying, and managing applications using containers. * **Version Control:** The \"latest\" tag implies a versioning system; students would learn about managing and tracking different versions of software. * **DevOps:** The image and its metadata are typical elements of a DevOps workflow where automated processes build and deploy software. * **Cloud Computing:** The repository likely resides on a cloud-based platform, illustrating how cloud services manage software artifacts. Overall, the image provides a snapshot of the status and information about a specific container image in a version control system, demonstrating a real-world example of concepts used in software engineering and cloud technologies.

In this case, it's \"coolsisters7/llm.\" This suggests a project named \"llm\" belonging to a user or organization named \"coolsisters7.\" \"llm\" likely stands for \"large language model,\" which is a common term in computer science and AI. * **Last Pushed:** This indicates the last time an update (or \"push\") was made to the project. It shows \"about 1 month ago.\" * **Contains:** This column specifies the type of content within the project. Here it displays \"IMAGE,\" meaning the project contains at least one image file. * **Visibility:** This shows the accessibility of the project. \"Public\" means anyone can view the project's contents. * **Scout:** This likely indicates the status of automated monitoring or scanning of the project. \"Inactive\" suggests that this feature is currently turned off. In short, the image depicts a summary of a publicly accessible project containing at least one image, which hasn't been updated for about a month and has automated monitoring disabled. The project's name suggests it may relate to large language models.

The project requires several components to be submitted and publicly available: a Docker image on Dockerhub, a public GitHub repository, a `Dockerfile` within the root of that repository, and an MIT license in the repository root. The evaluation shows that the student's GitHub repository and its required files are in order (`PASS` for GitHub repo, `Dockerfile`, and MIT license). However, the Docker image is missing or not public on Dockerhub (`FAIL`). Because one prerequisite wasn't met, the overall prerequisites status is `FAIL`, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The student's submission will not be evaluated until the missing Docker image is corrected.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/163", "type": "discourse_post"}

The task involves analyzing a large Apache web server log file (61MB, 258,074 rows) from the website `s-anand.net` for the month of May 2024. The website features a section dedicated to \"telugu\" music content. **The Goal:** The students need to determine the number of successful GET requests made to the `/telugu/` section of the website on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 (GMT-0500). A successful request is defined as having an HTTP status code between 200 and 299 (inclusive). **The Challenge:** The log file's format presents several complexities: * **Non-standard format:** Fields are space-separated, with most enclosed in double quotes, except the `Time` field. Quotes are escaped using `\\\"`, not `\"\"`, adding further complexity. This impacts 41 rows. * **Timezone:** The data is in the GMT-0500 timezone. * **Large Dataset:** The sheer size of the log file (258,074 rows) requires efficient data processing techniques. **The Data:** Each row in the log file contains the following fields: IP address, remote logname, remote user, time of visit, request (including method, URL, and protocol), status code, response size, referrer, user agent, virtual host, and server IP address. **The Application:** Successfully completing the analysis will allow for: * **Infrastructure Optimization:** Efficiently scaling server resources to handle peak traffic. * **Content Strategy:** Identifying popular content to guide future investments. * **Marketing Insights:** Tailoring promotional efforts for maximum impact. In essence, this is a real-world data analysis problem that challenges students to clean, process, and analyze a large, messy dataset using appropriate tools and techniques to answer a specific business question. The exercise covers data cleaning, data filtering, and potentially the use of scripting languages (like Python) or data analysis software.

The data is presented in a non-standard format: space-delimited, with double-quoted fields, and some inconsistent quoting. Students must account for these complexities while extracting the relevant information. The analysis is framed within a business context, focusing on how the results can inform resource allocation (scaling servers), content strategy, and marketing efforts. The fields within each log entry are defined, and specific conditions (successful GET requests, time window, day of the week, URL path) are clearly stated to guide the analysis.

The scenario involves a company, ReceiptRevive Analytics, that specializes in recovering data from damaged paper receipts. Their client, RetailFlow Inc., has a large archive of digitized receipts containing sales information in JSON format, but the digitization process resulted in incomplete data—specifically, the \"id\" field is missing from many entries. The student's task is threefold: 1. **Parse the Sales Data:** Read a JSON file with 100 rows of sales data and extract the `sales` values, despite the missing `id` fields in some entries. This tests their ability to handle incomplete data and work with JSON files. 2. **Data Validation and Cleanup:** Clean and validate the extracted `sales` data, ensuring the program handles incomplete records gracefully. This focuses on data quality and robustness. 3. **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum all the extracted `sales` values to determine the total sales recorded across all 100 receipts. This tests their ability to perform basic calculations and aggregate data. The overall goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation using a real-world example of imperfect data. The case study also highlights the broader business value of data recovery and analysis, such as reconstructing historical sales trends and improving future data handling.

ReceiptRevive Analytics, a business intelligence firm, has received a JSON dataset containing sales data from RetailFlow Inc. The data, derived from digitized paper receipts, is incomplete due to damage to the original receipts. Many entries are truncated, specifically missing the `id` field. **The Student's Task:** Students are tasked with creating a program to: 1. **Parse the data:** Extract the `sales` values from the 100 rows of the provided JSON file, handling the missing `id` field and truncated data. 2. **Validate and clean the data:** Ensure the program accurately handles incomplete data entries. The focus should be exclusively on extracting the `sales` data. 3. **Calculate the total sales:** Sum the extracted `sales` values to determine the total sales revenue. **The Learning Objectives:** The case study assesses the student's skills in: * **Data Parsing:** Reading and processing JSON data, particularly handling incomplete or malformed entries. * **Data Cleaning and Validation:** Identifying and managing missing data, and implementing error handling strategies. * **Data Aggregation:** Calculating summary statistics from a dataset. * **Problem Solving:** Developing a robust solution to a real-world data problem. * **Programming:** Implementing the solution in a chosen programming language. The case study highlights the importance of data recovery and the real-world challenges faced in data analysis. The successful completion of this task would demonstrate a student's understanding of core data processing and analysis concepts.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/13", "type": "discourse_post"}

Here's a breakdown suitable for a student context: * **Style:** The artwork is in a detailed, almost illustrative style reminiscent of intricate engravings or steampunk aesthetics. The sepia tones and mechanical elements contribute to this feel. * **Composition:** The image is composed of many smaller panels arranged in a mosaic-like fashion. Each panel seems to contain different elements, including: * **Portraits:** Multiple portraits of men, some in formal attire, some in more casual clothing, are featured, suggesting the representation of different individuals or perhaps characters. * **Biographical Data:** Some panels appear to contain biographical snippets, job titles (like \"A Sutcase,\" possibly a misspelling of something else), or other text that suggests identifying information about these individuals. The language, such as \"Background Profile Earning\" and \"ADGDM EXTERIGNEG,\" could be made-up terminology or specialized jargon fitting the style. * **Technical Diagrams:** There are elements that resemble technical drawings, circuit diagrams, or mechanical schematics intermingled with the portraits and text. This suggests a connection between the individuals and technology or engineering. * **Gear and Cogs:** The pervasive use of gears, cogs, and other mechanical elements reinforces the steampunk or industrial-inspired theme. * **Possible Interpretations:** Depending on the context, this image could represent several things: * **A student's project:** It could be a final project for a design class, a self-promotional piece, or a representation of personal interests (e.g., a love of steampunk). * **A fictional narrative:** The mosaic structure and the combination of portraits, data, and mechanical elements hint at the possibility of a narrative, perhaps about a group of inventors, scientists, or engineers. * **Conceptual art:** The piece could simply be an exploration of visual themes related to identity, technology, and the intersection of the human and machine. In conclusion, this image is a visually rich and multifaceted piece that requires further context to understand fully. Its layered composition and stylistic choices make it a prime example of how diverse elements can be combined to create a compelling visual narrative. A student presenting this image would need to clearly explain its concept, meaning, and the choices made in its design.

The style is steampunk-influenced, with many gears, mechanical parts, and circuit-like diagrams integrated into the artwork. The collage includes: * **Portraits of students:** Several portraits of young men, some in graduation attire, suggesting different stages of education. * **Biographical information:** There are sections with text that might represent student IDs, biographical details, or academic accomplishments. The text is stylized and partly illegible, adding to the artistic effect. * **Mechanical and technological elements:** The prevalence of gears, cogs, and circuit diagrams creates a visual metaphor connecting education to technology and innovation. * **Cityscapes:** Background elements show cityscapes, possibly symbolizing the urban context of education or the ambition for future success. * **Hair and clothing details:** Close-ups of hair and clothing are presented as intricate illustrations, possibly emphasizing individual style or expression within the academic world. The overall effect is that of a complex and visually rich portrayal of the academic journey, combining the personal with technological and aspirational elements. It could be interpreted as artwork representing a student's ambition, achievements, and personal journey through education. The seemingly fictional names and stylized text adds a layer of mystery.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/65", "type": "discourse_post"}

Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/94", "type": "discourse_post"}

Key features include: * **Instructions:** The instructions explicitly state that students can use any resources they want (internet, AI tools, etc.) and that the exam is \"hackable,\" implying it's designed to be open and encourage exploration of solutions. The system saves answers automatically and frequently, preventing loss of work. * **Progress Tracking:** A \"Score\" is displayed at the top. The \"Recent saves\" section shows the student's scores from previous saves, indicating they've attempted the exam multiple times. The latest score is considered the official one. Buttons like \"Check all\" and \"Save\" are prominently featured for answer checking and submission. * **Student Login:** The student's ID (23f1002709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) is visible, indicating they are logged in to a system likely used by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITH). * **Community Support:** A link to \"Join the discussion on Discourse\" indicates a forum for students to ask questions and collaborate. In summary, this screenshot depicts a unique online assessment designed to be more open and collaborative than traditional exams, allowing students to leverage various resources for problem-solving. The open approach may be used to assess student learning in a way that better reflects real-world problem solving.

Key features for a student include: * **Instructions:** Clear instructions are provided, emphasizing that students can skip reading material if they already know the answer, check their answers frequently, and save their progress regularly. The instructions also explicitly state that the quiz's answers are stored locally in the browser, and students are allowed to use any resources they want, including online tools and collaboration. Critically, the instructions acknowledge that the quiz's code is potentially hackable. * **Save and Check Functionality:** Buttons to \"Save\" and \"Check\" their answers allow for continuous monitoring of progress and frequent saving to prevent data loss. * **Recent Saves:** A section showing recent saved attempts with timestamps and scores helps students track their performance over time and see their current best score. * **Discourse Forum:** A link to a discussion forum (\"Discourse\") provides a platform for students to ask questions and seek help if they encounter problems. * **Login Information:** The student's login information is displayed, confirming their identity within the system. In essence, this interface presents a quiz with a relatively open-book approach, encouraging students to utilize any available resources to answer questions while providing mechanisms to frequently save progress and check answers. The inclusion of \"hackable\" in the instructions is unusual and suggests a potentially unique educational approach or even a security-focused exercise.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/97", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_599854_0", "content": "@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

The assignment involves working with a dataset of patents. Specifically, there are two questions (Q1 and Q2). Q1 asks the student to identify the patent(s) with the highest number of claims, using a provided dataset. The student must then list the patent IDs, separated by commas, if multiple patents share the highest claim count. The format of the patent ID is explained, giving an example. Q2 is shown but the question itself is not visible. Both questions instruct the student to use AI tools to generate code to answer them. The overall task likely requires data processing and analysis skills, as well as an understanding of how to use AI-assisted coding.

The output should be a comma-separated list of patent IDs (no spaces). The question provides an example of a patent ID format. It implicitly involves data manipulation and potentially sorting or filtering capabilities. **Q2** is another question that requires the use of the dataset; however, the specific question is not visible in the image. The instruction \"Start coding or generate with AI\" suggests that students can either write code to solve the problem or use AI-assisted coding tools.

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Students are tasked with crafting a prompt that will make the LLM, which is programmed to never say \"Yes,\" output that word. The exercise simulates a real-world scenario where malicious actors might attempt to bypass security measures in LLMs. Successful completion requires understanding how LLMs process information and creatively overcoming their limitations. The use of an \"AI Proxy token\" suggests the exercise is conducted within a controlled environment, likely a platform designed for this type of LLM security testing. The exercise aims to highlight vulnerabilities in LLM security and improve the safety of deployed language models.

The context explains that this is a common security audit technique used by SecurePrompt Technologies, a cybersecurity firm, to test the robustness of their LLM security measures. Students are asked to think like a potential attacker, trying to find vulnerabilities in the LLM's programming. Success requires clever wording in the prompt to bypass the hardcoded restrictions.

For a student assignment, one could describe it as follows: The image depicts the iconic black flag of the Straw Hat Pirates, featuring a stylized skull wearing a straw hat. The skull has large, expressive eyes and a wide grin, giving it a mischievous and somewhat playful appearance, which contrasts with the typical menacing nature of pirate flags. The skull's arms are extended into crossbones, a traditional symbol of piracy. The flag itself billows in the wind, suggesting movement and a sense of adventure. It is attached to a mast of a ship, clearly indicating its maritime context. The design is simple but effective, conveying the crew's playful yet determined nature. The straw hat specifically identifies the crew, distinguishing it from other pirate flags and serves as a visual shorthand for *One Piece* fans. The colors—mostly black and white with accents of orange/yellow from the hat— are bold and easily memorable, typical of anime aesthetics. The overall effect is instantly recognizable to fans of the series and symbolizes the crew's journey and adventures at sea.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-shared-data-pool/169045/2", "type": "discourse_post"}

The repository is called \"ROE-Master-Snippets-File\" and belongs to user \"ritwiktrivedi.\" For students, this would represent a collaborative coding project. Key features shown include: * **Repository Name:** Suggests a collection of code snippets related to \"ROE\" (likely an acronym for a specific technology or project). \"Master\" likely indicates the main branch of the project. * **Contributors (4):** Four people have contributed code to this project. This highlights teamwork and version control. * **Issues (0):** Currently, there are no reported problems or bugs. This implies a well-maintained project. * **Stars (2):** Two people have \"starred\" the repository, indicating interest and potential value. This reflects community engagement. * **Forks (4):** Four people have created copies (\"forks\") of the repository to work on their own versions. This demonstrates the project's potential usefulness and adaptability for different applications. In short, this image depicts a relatively small but active open-source project on GitHub that could be used as a learning resource for students or a starting point for collaboration. The image of the user adds a personal touch, connecting the code to a person or team.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/roe-common-snippets-repo-feb-2025/168901/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_599766_0", "content": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_599787_0", "content": "Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

{"id": "discourse_599811_0", "content": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed . And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/9", "type": "discourse_post"}

For students, Discord is a popular communication app often used for: * **Group projects:** Students can create servers (like online communities) dedicated to specific classes or projects to share files, discuss ideas, and collaborate in real-time. Voice channels allow for immediate feedback and brainstorming sessions. * **Study groups:** Similar to group projects, Discord can facilitate studying together remotely. Students can share notes, ask questions, and quiz each other. * **Gaming and socializing:** Many students use Discord to connect with friends who play the same games, providing a platform for in-game communication and general socializing outside of class. * **Club and organization communication:** School clubs and organizations might use Discord servers to keep members updated on events, share announcements, and facilitate communication amongst the group. In short, Discord is a versatile tool that many students find helpful for academic collaboration, social interaction, and staying connected with friends and classmates.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/create-a-question-solving-groups-for-roe/168567/15", "type": "discourse_post"}

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.

We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

JSON is a way to store data in a structured format, similar to a dictionary or a list of key-value pairs. This particular JSON object describes a movie (or possibly a TV episode) with four attributes (or fields): * `\"id\"`: A unique identifier (\"tt7144296,\" likely from IMDb). * `\"title\"`: The title of the movie (\"1. Kiss and Kill\"). * `\"year\"`: The release year (2017). * `\"rating\"`: A numerical rating (2.9). The bottom section, \"Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9,\" indicates a successful test. A program was likely checking if the `rating` value in the JSON data was indeed 2.9. Since the expected value (2.9) matched the actual value (2.9), the test passed. This suggests a process of validating or verifying data extracted or processed from the JSON object. **In short:** The image illustrates a simple JSON object and a test confirming the accuracy of a data point within that object, demonstrating concepts relevant to data handling, testing, and potentially web development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/3", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment involves three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** The student must use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for Tel Aviv. This requires sending a GET request to obtain a location ID, then using that ID to get the forecast data from another API endpoint. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** The student needs to extract specific pieces of data (the `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`) from the API's response. 3. **Data Transformation:** The extracted data must be transformed into a JSON object. The `issueDate` will be the key, and the `enhancedWeatherDescription` will be the value for each key-value pair in the JSON. The provided example shows the desired JSON format. The final task for the student is to fill in the empty text box with the correctly formatted JSON representing the weather forecast for Tel Aviv. The error message \"SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input\" indicates that the student's current attempt is incorrect. The student needs to use the results of the API calls to build a correctly structured JSON object as shown in the example.

The exercise involves three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Students must use the BBC Weather API to get the `locationId` for Tel Aviv. This requires sending a GET request and using parameters like API key, locale, and the city name. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** Using the obtained `locationId`, students need to make another GET request to a weather broker API to retrieve the weather forecast data. 3. **Data Transformation:** The retrieved data contains an array of daily forecasts. Students must extract the `issueDate` (date) and `enhancedWeatherDescription` (weather summary) for each day. They then need to transform this data into a JSON object where the `issueDate` is the key and the `enhancedWeatherDescription` is the value. An example of the expected JSON output is provided. The final task is for the student to write the correct JSON object representing the weather forecast for Tel Aviv based on the instructions and the example.

They're likely working with GitHub Actions, a feature that automates tasks within a GitHub repository. The instructions tell the student to: 1. **Create a workflow:** A workflow is a set of automated steps (like building, testing, or deploying code). The workflow file must be located in the `.github/workflows` directory of their repository. 2. **Trigger and verify:** They need to trigger this workflow, wait for it to finish, and check the repository to ensure the workflow run is the most recent action and that it created a commit within 5 minutes. 3. **Enter Repository URL:** The student is asked to enter the URL of their GitHub repository in the provided text box, but there's an error: \"No executed job step matches 23f2003853@dsstudy.itm.ac.in\". This error message indicates a problem; either the workflow didn't run correctly, the provided URL is incorrect, or the workflow isn't properly configured to create the commit. The student needs to troubleshoot the issue before clicking the \"Check\" button to submit their work. In short, the image captures a moment of debugging during a student's practical exercise involving GitHub Actions and potentially version control. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/a/7ae7951e4e7d3ea76248632715b376e23d3b0a76_2_690x387.png [Caption] This image shows a student's GitHub Actions workflow. Specifically, it displays the workflow file for a run of a workflow named \"daily-commit\". **Key aspects for a student to understand:** * **GitHub Actions:** This is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform built into GitHub. It automates tasks like building, testing, and deploying code. * **Workflow File (`.yml`):** This file (`daily-commit.yml`) defines the steps the workflow takes. The code shows it runs daily at 10:00 AM UTC and allows for manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`. * **`on: schedule` and `cron`:** This section specifies the workflow's schedule, using a cron expression to run daily at 10 AM UTC. * **`jobs`:** This section defines the jobs within the workflow. Here, there is one job called \"daily-commit\". * **`runs-on`:** Specifies that the job runs on an Ubuntu latest virtual machine. * **`steps`:** The steps within the job. One step uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code from the repository. * **`persist-credentials`:** This setting is set to `false`, indicating that credentials are not persisted between steps (for security). * **Repository Name:** The workflow belongs to a repository owned by a user with email `23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. This suggests it is likely a student account associated with an educational institution. In short, the image depicts a simple automated workflow that likely performs some daily task, possibly related to a student's project or coursework, on a GitHub repository. The student has configured this workflow to run automatically on a schedule and also allows for manual initiation if needed.

The workflow, named \"daily-commit\", is configured to run daily at 10:00 AM UTC. It uses the `actions/checkout@v3` action to check out code from a repository, and then it appears to perform some Git configuration. The workflow is associated with a student's IIT Madras email address (23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in). The screenshot displays the workflow's YAML configuration file and shows that the workflow has successfully completed a run (#13).

The task requires students to: 1. **Extract data:** Obtain a table of student marks from a PDF file using specified Python libraries (Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2). The table contains student marks in Maths, Physics, English, Economics, and Biology. 2. **Clean and prepare data:** Convert the extracted marks into a numerical format suitable for calculations. 3. **Filter data:** Identify students who scored 17 or more in Physics and are in groups 43-66 (inclusive). 4. **Calculate:** Sum the Biology marks only for the students identified in step 3. This final sum is the answer to the question posed. The broader context explains how automating this process (using EduAnalytics) helps schools make better decisions about resource allocation, identify student performance trends, improve reporting efficiency, and support data-driven strategies. The task is designed to teach students practical data analysis skills relevant to education and other fields. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/a/1a9317fe7d6814de3d65512fa7b3121c5a3c8710.png [Caption] This is a student data analysis task. A PDF file (\"q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf\") contains a table of student marks across five subjects: Maths, Physics, English, Economics, and Biology. The task is to calculate the total Biology marks for a specific subset of students. The task is broken down into four steps: 1. **Data Extraction:** Students must use a PDF parsing library (Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2) to extract the data from the PDF into a usable format like a CSV file, Excel spreadsheet, or a DataFrame (a data structure used in programming). 2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The extracted data needs to be cleaned. This likely involves converting the marks (which might be in text format) into numerical data so that calculations can be performed correctly. 3. **Data Filtering:** The students need to filter the data to select only those students who scored 17 or more in Physics, and who are in groups 43 or 66 (or both). 4. **Calculation:** Finally, the students must calculate the sum of the Biology marks for the filtered students. The overall goal is to demonstrate understanding of data extraction, cleaning, filtering, and aggregation. The task also highlights the practical application of these skills in educational settings, showing how data analysis can support better decision-making in schools.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/55", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student is attempting to troubleshoot a workflow that's supposed to create a commit. The instructions clearly state the steps the student should follow after creating a workflow: 1. **Trigger the workflow:** Initiate the automated process. 2. **Check for the workflow:** Confirm that the workflow is the most recently recorded activity in the repository. 3. **Verify the commit:** Ensure a new commit is created within 5 minutes of the workflow run. The student has entered their repository URL (`https://github.com/DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM/TDS_GA_4`), but an error message appears: \"Error: No executed job step matches 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\". This indicates that the workflow failed to execute a specific job step, which is preventing the commit from being created. The student needs to investigate why this job step (identified by the unique ID) failed to run correctly. The error points to a problem within the workflow itself, and not necessarily with the repository URL. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/1/a17230380d3428649017c6e760ea0ece0b99bf39_2_690x315.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub Actions workflow run. Specifically, it displays the successful completion of a \"Daily Commit\" workflow, run number 10. For a student, here's a breakdown: * **GitHub Actions:** This is a feature within GitHub that automates tasks like running tests, building software, and deploying code. It's triggered by events (like a code push) or manually. * **Workflow:** A workflow defines a series of steps (jobs) to be executed. In this case, the workflow is named \"daily-commit\" and is triggered manually. The `.yml` file specifies these steps. * **Job:** A job is a single unit of work within a workflow. Here, there's only one job, also named \"daily-commit.\" * **Success:** The workflow run completed successfully. * **Total duration:** The workflow took 18 seconds to run. * **Manually triggered:** This workflow wasn't triggered automatically; someone started it manually. * **Main branch:** The workflow was run on the `main` branch of the repository. In short, this screenshot demonstrates a successful automated task (likely part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) process) that a student might encounter in a software engineering or DevOps context. The student can see that the process ran quickly and without errors. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/1/a17230380d3428649017c6e760ea0ece0b99bf39.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub Actions workflow run. A student might see this in a software development or DevOps course. Specifically, it displays: * **Workflow Name:** \"Daily Commit\" (run number 10). This suggests an automated process that runs daily, likely to integrate code changes. * **Workflow Trigger:** It was manually triggered 16 hours before the screenshot. This indicates that the student or someone on their team initiated the process, likely to test or deploy code. * **Workflow File:** `daily-commit.yml` This is the configuration file defining the steps in this workflow. `on: workflow_dispatch` specifies that this workflow can be manually triggered. * **Status:** \"Success\". The workflow completed successfully. * **Duration:** The workflow ran for 18 seconds. * **Jobs:** One job, named \"daily-commit\", executed within the workflow. It also finished successfully. * **Repository:** The workflow belongs to a repository belonging to a user named DigvijaysinhChudasamallTM, under the name TDS_GA_4. In short, the image depicts a successful, manually triggered workflow run for daily code integration, likely part of a larger software project or development cycle. The student would learn about automating tasks like testing, building, and deploying using GitHub Actions. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/7/67b187b35695e941e3bdf04461e4c4fa050c6e4d.png [Caption] This image shows a student's GitHub repository containing a workflow file (`daily-commit.yml`). This workflow is designed to automate daily commits to the repository. Let's break down the code: * **`name: Daily Commit`**: This is the name given to the workflow. * **`on: schedule:`**: This section specifies that the workflow should run on a schedule. * **`cron: \"0 0 * * *\"`**: This cron expression defines the schedule—it runs every day at midnight UTC. * **`workflow_dispatch:`**: This allows manual triggering of the workflow besides the scheduled run. * **`jobs: daily-commit:`**: This section defines the job (a set of steps) called \"daily-commit\". * **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`**: This specifies that the job should run on the latest Ubuntu virtual machine provided by GitHub Actions. * **`steps:`**: This section lists the individual steps within the job: * **`Checkout repository`**: This step checks out the repository's code to the virtual machine. * **`Set up Git configuration`**: This step configures Git with a temporary email address and username for the automated commit. * **`Create a file with a daily commit message`**: This step creates a text file (`daily-commit.txt`) containing a predefined commit message. * **`Commit changes`**: This step commits the newly created file (`daily-commit.txt`) with the message. In a student context, this demonstrates: * **Version Control (Git):** The use of Git and GitHub for managing code. * **GitHub Actions:** The use of GitHub Actions to automate tasks. * **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery):** A basic example of automating a part of the development workflow. * **Scripting/Automation:** The use of YAML to define the workflow and shell scripting (Bash) within the steps. * **Cron Jobs:** Demonstrates understanding of scheduled tasks. This is a relatively simple, but illustrative, example of how a student might use GitHub Actions to automate a repetitive task within their development process. It's a good example of practical application of various concepts often taught in introductory programming and software engineering courses. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/7/67b187b35695e941e3bdf04461e4c4fa050c6e4d_2_690x317.png [Caption] This image shows a student's GitHub repository containing a workflow file (`daily-commit.yml`). This YAML file defines a GitHub Action that automatically creates a daily commit to the repository. Specifically, the code: * **Schedules a daily run:** The `cron` entry specifies that the action runs every day at midnight UTC. * **Checks out the repository:** The `actions/checkout` action downloads the repository's code. * **Sets up Git configuration:** It configures the Git user email and name. This is important so the commits are properly attributed (to GitHub Actions). * **Creates a file:** A file named `daily-commit.txt` is created with a message indicating that it's an automated daily commit. * **Commits the changes:** The changes (the creation of `daily-commit.txt`) are then committed to the repository. The image shows the student's work in progress, likely part of a class assignment or personal project focused on learning about GitHub Actions, automation, and version control. The interface suggests the student is using the GitHub web interface to edit and review the workflow code.

After creating the workflow, they're following three steps: triggering the workflow, ensuring it's the most recent action, and verifying a commit was created within 5 minutes. They've entered their repository URL, but received an error message indicating that no executed job step matches a specific ID (\"21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\").

It emphasizes the benefits of automated PDF-to-Markdown conversion, including increased productivity, improved quality, better scalability, and easier integration into various digital platforms. The student is then presented with a sample section of the PDF's contents and asked to provide the correctly formatted Markdown version. The initial attempt is marked incorrect, and a note explains that perfect conversion from PDF to Markdown is difficult and usually requires manual adjustments. Using Prettier is suggested to improve consistency and standardization.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/70", "type": "discourse_post"}

This suggests a user-friendly approach to improvement. * **Workflow run summary:** The interface displays a summary of recent workflow runs. \"71 workflow runs\" indicates the total number of times workflows have executed. There is a specific run highlighted: * **User ID:** `23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` identifies the user or system responsible for this particular run. The `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` part suggests a university or institutional email address. * **Branch:** The run was performed on the `main` branch, the primary development branch of the project. * **Manual Run:** The note \"Manually run by 23f2003853\" clarifies that this run wasn't triggered automatically but initiated manually by the user. * **Time:** The run completed 23 minutes ago and took 19 seconds. In a student's context, this would likely represent a student working on a software project, possibly as part of a course or independent study, using GitHub Actions to automate parts of their development workflow (e.g., testing, building, deployment). The manually triggered run suggests they might be debugging or testing a specific change before committing it to the main branch.

The task is to build a system that retrieves weather data from the BBC Weather API, specifically for Osaka. The exercise has three parts: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Students must use the API and parameters like an API key and location ID to fetch weather forecast data. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** Students need to extract the relevant weather information from the API's response. 3. **Data Transformation:** The core of the exercise. Students must transform the data into a JSON object where the date (`issueDate`) is the key and the weather description (`enhancedWeatherDescription`) is the value. An example of the desired output is provided. The student's attempt at creating this JSON object is shown. However, an error message, \"Error: At root: Different number of properties,\" indicates that the student's JSON does not match the expected structure (likely due to an incorrect number of key-value pairs). The \"Check\" button presumably allows the student to submit their answer for evaluation.

This suggests that the content should be formatted as a list in Markdown. The error message \"Error: Missing lists\" confirms this.

The words are presented in a slightly disorganized way, with some phrases, short sentences, and individual words listed. The underlined words, such as \"cresco vomito\" and \"deputo ceno,\" might represent verb conjugations or phrases to be translated or analyzed. The bottom section, \"Cuppedia uberrime socius atque paens / Sto theca testimonium aestus debitis,\" looks like a sentence or two, possibly a more complex exercise for translating or parsing.

The exercise's goal is to illustrate the benefits of automating this conversion process for educational resource providers like EduDocs Inc. The benefits highlighted include increased productivity, improved document quality, better scalability, and easier integration into various digital platforms. The core task involves taking a sample Latin text (provided in the PDF, shown as a code block) and producing its Markdown equivalent. The exercise acknowledges that perfect automated conversion is difficult, and the student's answer will only be evaluated on a few basic aspects, likely to avoid issues caused by imperfect automated conversion tools. The error message \"Missing links\" suggests that the automated conversion might have failed to properly handle certain aspects of the original PDF, such as hyperlinks.

The exercise highlights the importance of this conversion in improving productivity, quality, scalability, and integration of educational resources. The student is given a sample PDF text and asked to determine its equivalent Markdown representation, using the \"prettier@3.4.2\" formatting tool. The question acknowledges the inherent difficulties in perfectly automating PDF-to-Markdown conversion, stating that manual corrections are often necessary. To simplify the task, the exercise only assesses a few basic aspects of the conversion. The error message \"Missing links\" suggests that the exercise may also involve checking for hyperlinks or other elements within the PDF, which is not included in the example text. Overall, the exercise aims to teach students about the practical challenges and importance of PDF to Markdown conversion.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/124", "type": "discourse_post"}

The task is to use the GitHub API to find GitHub users who meet specific criteria: located in Seattle and having over 120 followers. The goal is to determine the creation date (using the `created_at` field) of the *most recently created* profile among those users and format it according to the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). The instructions are broken down into three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Use the GitHub API to query for users based on location and follower count. 2. **Data Processing:** Filter the results to include only users meeting the specified criteria (Seattle, >120 followers). 3. **Sort and Format:** Sort the results by the `created_at` date (newest first) and format the date of the newest user in ISO 8601 format. The \"Impact\" section explains the strategic advantages of automating this process, including targeted recruitment, competitive intelligence, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. The student has made an incorrect attempt (2011-05-07T08:30:48Z), and the prompt gives additional hints for refining their search to ensure they're only looking at relevant profiles. The challenge reinforces concepts of API usage, data filtering, data sorting, and date formatting.

The task is to use the GitHub API to find the newest GitHub user profile in Seattle with over 120 followers. The assignment is broken down into three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Students must use the GitHub API's search functionality to retrieve data on users based on location (Seattle) and follower count (over 120). 2. **Data Processing:** Students need to filter the retrieved data to isolate only those users meeting the specified criteria. 3. **Sort and Format:** Students must sort the filtered data by the `created_at` field (date of account creation) to find the newest user and format this date according to the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). The assignment then explores the *impact* of automating this process, highlighting benefits like targeted recruitment, competitive intelligence, increased efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. A sample incorrect answer and additional hints are provided to guide the student. The final instruction clarifies to ignore users who joined after a specific date. This suggests the student needs to deal with date comparisons and potentially filtering out data based on that criteria.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/138", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment involves fetching weather data for London from the BBC Weather API. The student needs to perform three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Use the API to get a location ID for London. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** Use that location ID to get the weather forecast data. 3. **Data Transformation:** Create a JSON object where the date (issueDate) is the key and the weather description (enhancedweatherDescription) is the value. The example shows the expected JSON format. The student has attempted to provide the JSON output, but has made a mistake (indicated by the \"Property name mismatch\" error).

The task is broken into three parts: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Students must use the API to get the `locationId` for Manila, Philippines, by sending a GET request. They need to understand API keys, parameters, and how to make HTTP requests. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** Using the obtained `locationId`, students retrieve the weather forecast data for Manila from a specified API endpoint (likely another GET request). This involves understanding API responses and data structures. 3. **Data Transformation:** This is the core programming part. Students must parse the API's response, extracting the `issueDate` (date of the forecast) and `enhancedweatherDescription` (weather summary). They then need to create a JSON object where the `issueDate` is the key, and the `enhancedweatherDescription` is the value. This demonstrates JSON handling and data structuring skills in Python. The example JSON output shows the expected format, and a sample forecast for Manila is provided for the student to use as an example of the final data. This assignment tests students' abilities in API interaction, data parsing, and JSON manipulation within a real-world context (weather forecasting for agricultural purposes).

The task involves using the BBC Weather API to retrieve weather forecasts for Manila, Philippines. The assignment is broken down into three parts: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Students must use the API's locator service to get a unique identifier (`locationId`) for Manila. They then use this ID to make another API request to fetch the weather forecast data. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** Students extract relevant data points from the API's response—specifically, the `issueDate` (date of the forecast) and `enhancedWeatherDescription` (weather summary). 3. **Data Transformation:** Students process this extracted data to create a JSON object. This JSON object uses the `issueDate` as keys and the corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription` as values. The assignment provides an example of the desired JSON output format. Finally, the assignment includes a sample JSON output showing expected weather descriptions for Manila over several days to help students understand the final result. There's a \"Check\" button implying an automated system to verify the correctness of the student's JSON output. The overall goal is to build a system that automatically retrieves and formats weather data from a public API.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/167", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student learning JSON and error handling would find this relevant. The top portion displays what appears to be a partially-completed JSON object. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for transmitting data. The object includes fields for \"id\", \"title\", \"year\", and \"rating,\" which are typical in media databases (like movie information). The bottom portion is an error message. The error says \"Values don't match,\" which means the data entered for the \"year\" field doesn't conform to an expected format. The system expected a year in the format \"2025-\", but the actual value provided was \"2025\". This highlights the importance of data validation and correct formatting in programming. The \"[10]\" suggests line 10 of the code or data may be the source. A student might use this example to learn about: * **JSON syntax:** The correct way to structure JSON objects, including key-value pairs and data types. * **Data validation:** The importance of checking if data conforms to specified formats. * **Error messages:** How to interpret and debug error messages that appear during programming. * **String formatting:** How to properly format data, such as dates, according to specific requirements.

The discrepancy lies in an expected hyphen at the end that isn't present, which is a subtle but important detail that often trips up beginners when working with data validation and expected formats in JSON. The error message indicates that the validation is failing due to this missing (or unexpected) trailing hyphen in the 'year' field.

The exercise involves: 1. **Understanding CORS:** The student needs to know what CORS is and why it's necessary to allow GET requests from different origins (websites). 2. **API Endpoint URL:** The student is asked to provide the URL of their API endpoint. They correctly input `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, which is a common localhost address. The system confirms this is correct. 3. **Testing with Query Parameters:** The next step involves testing the CORS configuration by sending GET requests to the API endpoint with a `?country=` query parameter. This means the student will append different country codes to the URL to see if the API responds correctly. The student is prompted to click a \"Check\" button to submit their answer. In essence, the screenshot shows a step in an interactive tutorial or programming assignment designed to teach students about CORS and its implementation. The student is actively demonstrating their understanding by providing the API endpoint and preparing for further testing.

The task is to configure a web application to accept requests from any origin. The student has correctly entered their API endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`) into the input field, which has been marked as \"Correct.\" The next step involves testing this by sending requests to the API, appending the parameter `?country=` followed by a country name to the URL. This suggests the API is likely designed to retrieve information based on the country specified. The \"Check\" button awaits the student to proceed with this testing phase. The entire exercise focuses on understanding and implementing CORS, a crucial concept in web development for secure communication between different domains.

The code appears to be attempting to fetch weather data. **Code Breakdown:** * **`datelist` creation:** The code generates a list of dates using the `pandas` library (`pd`). It then formats these dates as strings (YYYY-MM-DD). * **`weather_data` creation:** This part creates a dictionary that maps dates to weather descriptions. The source of `daily_summary_list` isn't shown in the image but it's assumed to provide the weather descriptions for each date. * **JSON Conversion:** The `weather_data` dictionary is converted to a JSON string using the `json` library. * **Error:** The code fails with an `IndexError: list index out of range` error on line 24. This means the code is trying to access an index in a list or dictionary that doesn't exist. Specifically, the problem is in accessing `result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`. This suggests that either `result['response']`, `result['response']['results']`, or `result['response']['results']['results']` doesn't contain the expected number of elements, or possibly the structure of the JSON response is unexpected. * **Debugging:** The error points to a problem in how the code handles the JSON response received from `'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' + ...`. The code needs to be reviewed to correctly handle different possible JSON responses, or to validate the response structure before accessing specific indices. **Student Context:** This is a typical example of a debugging task a student would encounter in a programming class focusing on data retrieval and manipulation. The student needs to understand: * **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, and JSON objects. * **Error Handling:** How to identify and fix `IndexError`. * **API Interaction:** Understanding how to fetch and parse data from external sources. * **Debugging Techniques:** Examining the variable contents (e.g., `result`) to understand the cause of the error. The student would likely need to examine the structure of the JSON data returned by the BBC weather API to correct the indexing. They may need to use debugging tools or `print` statements to inspect the contents of `result` to see which part of the nested structure is empty or causing the index error. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/9/5936d1d70999c4944a8f11097d2e36da3047c086_2_690x388.jpeg [Caption] The image shows a student's Python code and the resulting error message. The code attempts to: 1. **Create a list of dates:** It generates a list of dates using the `pandas` library (`pd.date_range`). 2. **Map dates to weather descriptions:** It appears to be trying to combine dates with weather descriptions from a data source (presumably `daily_summary_list`). 3. **Convert to JSON:** It converts the combined date-description data into a JSON formatted string using the `json` library. 4. **Fetch weather data:** This part of the code is where the error occurs. It's making a request to a BBC weather API (`https://www.bbc.com/weather/`) using the `requests` library. The problematic line attempts to extract a location ID from the API response using nested indexing (`result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`). The **error message**, `IndexError: list index out of range`, indicates that the code is trying to access an index in a list that doesn't exist. This likely means the structure of the JSON response from the BBC weather API is different than what the student expected (the `'results'['results']` part is suspicious). The API response probably doesn't have a list of results with enough elements, or perhaps the key 'results' is missing, resulting in an attempt to access an element at an index that is beyond the bounds of the list. The student needs to debug their code by either: * **Inspecting the API response:** Printing the `result` variable would show the actual structure of the JSON data returned from the BBC weather API, allowing the student to correct the indexing. * **Adding error handling:** Implementing a `try-except` block to handle potential `IndexError` exceptions would make the code more robust. * **Correcting the URL or API call:** Verifying that the URL is correct and that they are correctly accessing the desired data within the JSON response from the API. In short, the image captures a common debugging scenario for students learning to work with APIs and JSON data in Python. The `IndexError` points to a mismatch between the student's assumptions about the API response and the reality of the data returned.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/209", "type": "discourse_post"}

The primary window shows the BBC Weather website, which is searching for weather information in Karachi, Pakistan. A world map on the BBC Weather site shows weather icons for various global cities. A second, more technical window is open, likely a browser's developer tools. This window displays network activity related to the weather website's request. The detailed network information shows HTTP requests, response times, and data sizes, providing insights into how the website loads and fetches weather data. Specific data such as request times (e.g., 2.31 s) and data sizes (e.g., 436 B) are visible. The presence of the developer tools suggests the student might be involved in web development, debugging, or network analysis. The bottom of the screen shows a Windows activation prompt, indicating the operating system is not fully activated. Other open windows hint at other applications used by the student including what appears to be email, possibly a grading platform, and various other tabs which are largely unidentifiable.

The program is trying to extract data, specifically the title, year, rating, and ID of a movie, from an online database, likely IMDb. The JSON data snippet shows partially correct information: a year (\"2024\"), rating (\"6.0\"), and an ID (\"tt30292390\"). However, the title field is missing, or rather, it contains an incorrect value. The error message explains the problem: at index 10 of the data array, the extracted movie title doesn't match the expected title. The expected title appears to be in German (\"11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg\"), while the program actually retrieved a different title (\"11. The Calendar Killer\"). The bottom message notes that IMDb search results can vary by region and change over time. This suggests the student needs to handle these inconsistencies in their code, possibly by adding error handling or a more robust data retrieval and translation mechanism. The student's web scraper needs to be updated or modified to correctly handle this situation. They'll need to potentially implement regional checks or title translation to fix this discrepancy.

The code attempts to extract data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) in JSON format. The JSON data includes the year (2024), a rating (6.0), and an IMDb ID (tt30292390). However, there's an error message indicating a mismatch in the movie title. The program expected the German title \"11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg,\" but instead received \"11. The Calendar Killer.\" The error message also notes that IMDb search results vary by region and that titles may change over time, suggesting the program needs adjustments to handle these variations, possibly involving manual title translation or code updates to rescrape the data. This would be relevant for students learning about web scraping, data handling, error handling, and internationalization in programming.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/245", "type": "discourse_post"}

A partially completed answer is shown, but there's an error: a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')` message appears at the bottom. The \"Check\" button likely submits the student's JSON response for evaluation by the system. The error message suggests the student's JSON structure is incorrect or that the code attempting to process the JSON is trying to access a property ('id') that doesn't exist.

The API should have an endpoint (like `/api/outline`) that accepts a `country` parameter. 2. **Fetching Wikipedia Content:** The API needs to retrieve the HTML content from the Wikipedia page for the specified country. 3. **Extracting Headings:** Using an HTML parsing library (BeautifulSoup or lxml are suggested), the API needs to extract all headings (H1 to H6) from the fetched Wikipedia page and maintain their order. 4. **Generating Markdown Outline:** The extracted headings must be formatted into a Markdown outline, where each heading level is represented by a corresponding number of `#` symbols (e.g., `# Main Heading`, `## Subheading`). 5. **Enabling CORS:** The API needs to be configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests, allowing access from any origin.

The highlighted section shows a specific news item's data. For a student, this would be relevant to understanding: * **XML Structure:** The file demonstrates the hierarchical structure of XML with nested tags like ` `, ` `, ` `, ` `, etc. showing how data is organized. * **RSS Feeds:** The file is an example of an RSS feed, a common format for web syndication. Students would learn how websites use RSS to distribute updates to news aggregators or readers. * **Data Representation:** The XML contains metadata about a news article including the title, a link to the article, publication date, comments link, points (presumably votes), and the author. This is a way to represent structured data in a machine-readable format. * **Web Technologies:** This ties in with web development concepts like data exchange and how websites communicate with each other. * **Data Extraction:** Students could learn to parse this XML to extract specific pieces of information programmatically. This could be done using tools or libraries in various programming languages. In summary, the image provides a practical example of XML and RSS, illustrating how structured data is represented and used on the web. It could be used in a computer science, web development, or data management class.

The student is tasked with converting a PDF file (provided as `q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf`) into Markdown format. The exercise has three steps: 1. **Extraction:** Extract the text content from the PDF, carefully preserving the original formatting and structure as much as possible. 2. **Formatting:** Format the extracted Markdown content using the Prettier code formatter (version 3.4.2). This step ensures consistent styling and readability. 3. **Submission:** Submit the final, formatted Markdown file to the LMS. The exercise explains the broader impact of this task: automating the PDF-to-Markdown conversion process enhances productivity, improves the quality and consistency of documents, allows the organization to handle larger volumes of work, and improves integration with various digital platforms. A sample PDF is provided containing the text `[tricesimus admitto](https://example.com/tricesimus-admitto)`, `Suggero comes denique argentum.`, `Desipio crudelis antea quis.`, and `[adeptio colligo](https://example.com/adeptio-colligo)`. The student needs to correctly format this within the markdown and submit it. The system indicates that obtaining a perfect result is difficult, and it will only check for the few basic elements present in the example. The error message \"Missing code\" suggests the student's submission is incomplete or incorrect.

The task is to convert a PDF document (provided as `q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf`) into Markdown format. The exercise is broken down into three steps: 1. **PDF to Markdown Conversion:** Extract the text from the PDF, ensuring the original formatting and structure are preserved as much as possible during the conversion process. 2. **Markdown Formatting:** Use the Prettier code formatter (version 3.4.2) to standardize the converted Markdown. This ensures consistent formatting. 3. **Submission:** Submit the final, formatted Markdown file. The exercise emphasizes the importance of automating this PDF-to-Markdown conversion for efficiency and consistency in creating educational resources. It highlights the benefits: increased productivity, improved quality and readability, enhanced scalability, and easier integration with various digital platforms. The student is given a sample of the expected output from the PDF, showing both properly formatted Markdown (links and text) and a clear error message indicating missing code. The final instructions acknowledge the challenges involved in perfectly converting PDFs to Markdown and state that this exercise only tests for basic correctness.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/273", "type": "discourse_post"}

( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem ) image 1483×687 48.1 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/5/45b8773aa8f61abb7b67eaa7e81ae42fcfc0e576.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student's interface for a graded assignment. Several key features are present: * **Discourse Forum Integration:** The system encourages participation in a class discussion forum called \"Discourse.\" Students who contribute relevant questions or replies to the specified thread (\"GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\") will receive one bonus mark on their assignment grade. A link is provided to join the discussion. * **Student Login:** The student is logged in, with their student ID clearly visible (partially obscured for privacy). A logout button is also available. * **Assignment Progress/Saves:** The \"Recent saves\" section displays the student's most recent submission attempts along with timestamps and scores. The most recent attempt is considered their official score. The student has saved their work three times, earning scores of 10 and 8 (twice). The \"Reload\" buttons likely allow the student to revert to a previous save. In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a learning management system (LMS) integrating a discussion forum to promote active learning and collaboration, while also providing a clear way for students to track their progress and submissions for a graded assignment.

Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)” What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Screenshot 2025-02-09 175948 1823×850 82.3 KB Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database: { “2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”, “2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”, “2025-02-21”: “Sunny and a moderate breeze”, “2025-02-22”: “Light snow and a moderate breeze” } [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/b/cb0483e0b093e1e994ba44b8136f6b4f5865cdc7.png [Caption] This image shows a student's progress on a coding assignment involving a weather API. The assignment has three parts: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** The student needs to use the BBC Weather API to get the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. This involves sending a GET request to obtain a location ID and then using that ID to retrieve weather data. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** The student extracts relevant data (forecast description and date) from the API response. 3. **Data Transformation:** The extracted data is transformed into a JSON object. The date serves as the key, and the weather description is its value. An example of the expected JSON output is provided. The student's attempt at creating the JSON object is shown in the bottom section. However, there's an error (\"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')\") indicating a problem with their code. The error suggests they are trying to access a property ('id') that doesn't exist in the data they've retrieved from the API. This likely means there's an issue in how they are handling the API response or accessing the necessary data fields within it. The student has a score of 3 out of 10, suggesting that more parts of the assignment need to be completed correctly.

The task is to retrieve a weather forecast for Nur-Sultan using the BBC Weather API, and then format the data into a JSON object. The assignment is broken down into three steps: 1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** This involves making GET requests to a locator service to get a location ID, and then using that ID to fetch the weather forecast data from a weather broker API. The student needs to use API keys and other parameters correctly. 2. **Weather Data Extraction:** The student needs to extract specific data points (`issueDate` and `enhancedweatherDescription`) from the API response. 3. **Data Transformation:** The extracted data must be transformed into a JSON object where the `issueDate` is the key and the `enhancedweatherDescription` is the value. An example of the desired JSON output is provided. The screenshot shows the student's attempt at the final step. They have partially completed the JSON, but they have encountered an error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')`. This error indicates a problem in their code, likely related to accessing a property (`id`) that doesn't exist in the data they received from the API. The student needs to debug their code to fix this error and successfully complete the assignment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/305", "type": "discourse_post"}

The question asks what the JSON data is. The box displays what appears to be a JSON array of movie objects. Each movie object has a title, year, rating, and ID. However, there's an error message at the bottom: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')`. This means the code trying to access this JSON data is failing because it can't find the data it expects. The student would need to debug the code causing this error to correctly interpret the JSON data. The JSON itself seems well-formed, but it's not being accessed correctly by the surrounding program. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/b/2b416c389edbb461f8f61e84d1ab68d273774860_2_690x113.png [Caption] This image shows a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data structure. JSON is a lightweight format for exchanging data. In a student context, this would be relevant to courses involving: * **Programming:** Students learn to parse and utilize JSON data in various programming languages (like Python, JavaScript, etc.). This example shows a list of objects, each representing a movie with properties like `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating`. * **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Understanding how data is structured and organized is key. This example demonstrates a simple array of objects—a fundamental data structure. * **Web Development:** JSON is frequently used in web applications to send and receive data between servers and clients. Students might work with APIs that return data in JSON format. * **Databases:** JSON is sometimes used within databases to store semi-structured data. The `TypeError` at the bottom indicates a problem in the code attempting to access this JSON data. This error typically means the program is trying to read a property from a variable that currently holds a `null` value, instead of the expected JSON object. This is a common debugging scenario for students learning to handle external data sources.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/351", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student (22f200008) is encountering a `NameError` in their Python code. The error occurs because the variable `location_id` is not defined before being used in a URL string designed to fetch weather data from BBC Weather. The student is seeking help debugging the code, specifically addressing why it cannot find the location ID for Nur-Sultan. The post is part of a graded assignment for the course and the timestamp shows the post was made on January 31st, with a response time of 10 days. The screenshot highlights the relevant lines of code within the error message. The number 168/360 suggests that this is post 168 out of 360 in a forum or discussion board for the course.

The student's code snippet shows the URL construction attempting to use the undefined variable.

Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

Students can earn one bonus mark on a graded assignment by participating in a discussion thread (\"GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\") on the online forum called \"Discourse.\" The middle section shows the student is logged in under the username \"22f3000370@ds.study.iitm.ac.in,\" with a \"Logout\" button available. The bottom section displays recent saved scores on what appears to be an assignment, showing the dates and times of saving and the scores achieved (8, 8, and 7). The phrase \"most recent is your official score\" indicates that the last saved score is the official one. The repeated use of \"Reload\" suggests a system for saving and potentially reloading work. The information implies the student has recently worked on and saved their progress multiple times.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignments-dashboard-scores-incorrect-missing/166816/17", "type": "discourse_post"}

The exam platform provides clear instructions: * **Frequent Saving:** Students are encouraged to save their work frequently to ensure their progress is recorded. The last saved submission will be graded. * **Reloading Allowed:** Reloading the page is permitted; answers are stored client-side (in the student's browser), not on the server. However, minor variations might occur due to randomized parameters. * **Resource Access:** The exam allows the use of any resources—internet searches, AI tools like ChatGPT, external help, and any programming libraries or frameworks. Even \"hacking\" the code is permitted. * **Multiple Servers:** The exam utilizes multiple servers that must all be running concurrently for checking and saving answers. The interface also displays: * **Current Score:** The student's current score is shown as 0. * **Previous Saves:** A history of previous saved scores is displayed, indicating attempts with scores of 8, 8, and 6.5. * **Login Information:** The student's login ID is visible. * **Discourse Link:** A link to a discussion forum (Discourse) is provided for assistance. The overall impression is that this is a unique exam environment designed to be open and flexible, allowing students to use any resources available, while still testing their programming skills. The multiple-server requirement likely adds an element of complexity related to concurrency or distributed systems. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/1/410110dcdcd78d87c2d825c7f2f96f72dfb4b5b1_2_690x388.png [Caption] This image shows a student's screen during an online programming exam. The exam interface is dark-themed and provides several key instructions: * **Saving:** Students are instructed to save their work regularly using the \"Save\" button. Their last saved submission will be graded. Multiple saves are permitted. * **Reloading:** Reloading the page is acceptable; answers are stored client-side (in the student's browser), not on the server. Minor changes to questions might occur due to randomized parameters. * **Resource Use:** Students are explicitly allowed to use any resources they choose, including the internet, ChatGPT, and other external help. Even \"hacking\" the code to find answers is permitted. * **Multiple Servers:** The exam involves running multiple servers concurrently. All servers must be running while saving or checking answers. The interface also shows: * **Score:** The current score displayed is 0. * **Recent Saves:** A log of previous saved attempts with timestamps and scores is shown. * **Discourse Link:** A link to a Discourse forum is provided for students to ask questions. * **Login Information:** The student's login details are visible, although partially obscured for privacy. In summary, this exam appears to be designed to be open-ended and test a student's ability to solve problems using any available resources, while also managing a multi-server environment. The liberal use of external resources is unusual for a typical exam.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignments-dashboard-scores-incorrect-missing/166816/20", "type": "discourse_post"}

Key details for students include: * **No in-class quizzes:** Assessment is entirely based on the listed assignments. * **End-term exam:** A mandatory, in-person exam on April 13th, 2025. Eligibility requires an average of at least 40 out of 100 on the best two out of the first five weekly assignments. * **Assignments:** The course involves: * **ROE1:** A 45-minute remote online exam with objective assessments (March 2nd, 2025). * **P1 & P2:** Two take-home projects (open internet access). Each project has two components: a submission and a peer review, weighted 80% and 20% respectively. Specific dates are listed in the table. * **GAA:** The score from the best four out of seven weekly assignments completed on an online portal. * **Grading:** The final course score is calculated using a weighted average of the GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, and the final exam (F), with the weights shown in the formula at the bottom. Note that there are two slightly different versions of the formula presented. Students should clarify which one is correct.

Note the differences between submission and peer review deadlines for the projects. **Grading:** The final course grade is calculated using a weighted average of the four components (GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, and F), with varying weights assigned to each. Two slightly different versions of the grading formula are shown. Students should clarify which one is the correct formula with their instructor. **Eligibility:** Students must attend the final exam to receive a course grade. In addition, to be eligible to attend the final exam, students need an average of at least 40/100 on the best 2 of their first 5 weekly assessment scores.

It displays a project's directory structure and recent activity. For a student, this could represent: * **Project Organization:** The folders \"Business\" and \"Operations\" suggest a structured project with different functional areas. The \"app\" folder likely contains the core application code. The presence of `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` indicates a software project following best practices. * **Version Control:** The timestamps (\"2 days ago\", \"yesterday\", \"3 days ago\") and descriptions of changes (e.g., \"Reconfigured tasks,\" \"Updated Dockerfile\") show the history of modifications. This is crucial for collaborative projects and demonstrating iterative development. * **Software Development Practices:** The inclusion of a `Dockerfile` suggests the use of Docker for containerization, a common practice in modern software development. The `LICENSE` file indicates an open-source or proprietary license. `README.md` provides project documentation, essential for understanding the project's purpose and usage.

The \"1\" indicates it might be the first project in a series. * **`By arnavmehta2025`**: Confirms the student's ownership. * **`Updated 2 days ago`**: Shows the project's recent activity. * **Icon**: The cube-like icon might represent a 3D model or a data structure commonly used in programming projects. * **`0` (star) and `16` (download)**: These numbers indicate that the project has zero stars (favorites/likes) and 16 downloads. This suggests the project may be relatively new or not yet widely shared. In short, it's a snapshot of a student's first LLM-related project, recently updated and available for others to view or download. The context suggests a course or program focused on AI and programming.

It's the top-level directory containing all the project files. * **_pycache_:** This is a hidden folder automatically generated by Python. It stores compiled bytecode to speed up program execution. Students shouldn't directly modify this folder. * **Dockerfile:** This file contains instructions for building a Docker image. This suggests the project might be designed to run in a containerized environment. This is a good practice for reproducibility and deployment. * **LICENSE:** This file contains the project's license information (e.g., MIT, GPL). Important for open-source projects. * **app.py:** This is likely the main application file, containing the core logic of the LLM project. * **datagen.py:** This file probably contains code for generating data used in the project. Common in machine learning projects. * **evaluate.py:** This suggests the project includes code to evaluate the performance of the LLM. * **requirements.txt:** This crucial file lists all the project's dependencies (libraries). It allows others to easily recreate the project's environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. * **tasksA.py & tasksB.py:** These files likely contain different functionalities or aspects of the LLM project, potentially split into modular components for better organization. In summary, the image depicts a well-organized Python project, possibly for a course or independent study, focusing on LLMs and utilizing best practices like Docker and version control (implied by the LICENSE file).

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1.

The student is attempting to send a POST request to a server located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/run`. The request's purpose is to sort an array of contacts from a JSON file. The request includes a parameter `task` specifying the operation. The server responded with a `200 OK` status code, indicating successful processing of the request, but the JSON response shows an error message: `\"Failed to sort contacts: File /data/contacts.json does not exist\"`. This error indicates that the server-side code couldn't locate the necessary JSON file (`/data/contacts.json`) needed to perform the sorting operation. The student likely needs to check the file path and ensure the file exists in the expected location on the server. The image provides a valuable debugging snapshot for understanding the issue.

However, the response body contains a JSON error message: `\"Failed to count Wednesdays: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/dates.txt'\"`. This error clearly shows that the server could not find the specified file. The `[Errno 2]` part points to a common operating system error indicating a file not found. In short, the screenshot depicts a debugging scenario where a student's program, expecting a `dates.txt` file, is failing because the file is missing from its expected location.

The student is making a POST request to a local server (`http://localhost:8000/run`) to run a script named `datagen.py`. The request includes a parameter `task` with the value \"Install uv (if required) and...\". The server responded with a 200 OK status code, indicating success, but the response body contains an error message. The error message states that the `datagen.py` script failed to execute, returning a non-zero exit status of 2. The script attempted to access a file from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`). The error suggests a problem during the script's execution, possibly due to issues with the file access, dependencies, or the script's logic itself. The student needs to troubleshoot the script to resolve the error. The application's interface suggests the use of a tool like Postman or a similar API testing platform.

The request is intended to run a Python script (`datagen.py`) located on a remote GitHub repository. The script's purpose appears to be data generation, possibly as part of a data science project. The request includes a parameter `task` with the value \"Install uv (if required) and ...\", suggesting the script might have optional dependencies. The server responded with a 200 OK status code, indicating successful request reception, but the response body contains an error message: \"Failed to run datagen.py...\". This error message reveals that the execution of the Python script failed on the server, returning a non-zero exit status (2). This likely indicates an error within the `datagen.py` script itself, possibly due to issues with dependencies, incorrect code, or problems accessing the specified files. The student now needs to debug the Python script to fix the error.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/regarding-project1-for-file-not-detecting-after-sending-post-request/167172/14", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student familiar with the command line would recognize this as the output of the `ls /` command, which lists the contents of the root directory. The directories listed (e.g., `/bin`, `/boot`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/usr`) are standard directories found in most Linux systems, each serving a specific purpose. For example: * `/bin`: Contains essential binary executables. * `/boot`: Contains files required for booting the system. * `/etc`: Contains configuration files. * `/home`: Contains users' home directories. * `/usr`: Contains most of the system's software. The username `vikramjncasr` and the path `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1` suggest the user is working on a project related to IIT Madras within a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment (indicated by the `/mnt/c` path, a common way to access Windows drives in WSL). The `sudo` command in the initial lines suggests the user may have elevated privileges for certain actions. In a student's context, this image could be used to illustrate: * **Basic Linux commands:** Specifically, the `ls` command and its use in navigating the filesystem. * **Linux file system structure:** Showing the organization of key directories in a typical Linux system. * **WSL usage:** Demonstrating a common way students might access Linux environments on Windows-based systems. * **Unix-like commands:** The output provides visual examples of command-line output, showing paths, files, and directories. Overall, the image provides a concise example of a common task in a Linux environment, which is valuable for teaching introductory concepts in operating systems and command-line interfaces.

{"id": "discourse_594766_0", "content": "Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.

The top section asks the user to provide a GitHub Pages URL, which would typically follow the format `https://[USERNAME].github.io/[REPOSITORY_NAME]`. The `[USER]` and `[REPO]` are placeholders. The lower section shows an error message indicating that a specific URL (22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) is not found. Following this error is a snippet of HTML code, seemingly from a webpage titled \"Dolphin Facts\". This HTML sets basic page styling (font, background color, text alignment, etc.). The error likely means the webpage the URL is supposed to point to either doesn't exist or is inaccessible. The error might be due to incorrect input of username or repository name, a deployment issue, or a network problem. The error message is likely relevant to a student's attempt at creating or accessing a website via GitHub Pages. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/2/f2485af8a009f815219a3df4bbdf15db1322608e_2_690x77.png [Caption] This image shows a student's attempt to create a GitHub Pages website. The top line asks \"What is the GitHub Pages URL?\". The student has been given a template `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/` to fill in with their username ([USER]) and repository name ([REPO]). Below, there's an empty input box, indicating where the student should enter their URL. However, underneath that, an error message appears: `Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response`. This error suggests that the URL the student is trying to use (which is hidden) is not associated with the expected GitHub Pages site. Further down, some HTML code is visible. This is likely from the student's website's source code. The code shows basic HTML structure (doctype, html, head, title, style) and suggests the site is set to use Arial font, have a light blue background and dark text. The code snippet is a hint to the student to find where the issue is in the code. The error message means the page the student is expecting (probably indicated by the `22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` email-like address) cannot be found by the browser. The student needs to debug their URL and website setup.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/4", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is working on a web application deployed on Vercel. The top line shows the expected format of a Vercel URL, including the `/api` endpoint, suggesting they are likely working with an API. The second line shows the student's actual Vercel URL which appears to be correctly formatted. The error message \"TypeError: Failed to fetch\" at the bottom indicates that the code attempting to access this URL has failed. This error usually means the application or API at that URL is not responding correctly, is down, or there's a problem with the network connection or the code making the fetch request itself. The student needs to troubleshoot this fetch error to debug their application.

The code reads student data from a CSV file (`q-fastapi.csv`) and creates a simple API endpoint (`/api`) that returns this data. The API is designed to optionally filter students based on their class using query parameters. The code includes: * **Import statements:** Importing necessary libraries like `FastAPI`, `Query`, `CORSMiddleware`, `List`, `Optional`, and `csv`. * **CORS middleware:** The code enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from any origin, method, and header – important for development and testing, but potentially a security risk in a production environment. * **Data loading:** The code reads student data (student ID and class) from a CSV file into a list of dictionaries. * **API endpoint (`/api`):** This endpoint handles GET requests. It accepts an optional `class_` parameter to filter results. The `print` statements are likely for debugging purposes. * **Uvicorn execution:** The code uses Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) at port 8000. The terminal window shows the Uvicorn server successfully starting and handling several GET requests to the `/api` endpoint, both with and without filtering parameters, indicating successful execution. The right-hand side shows a web browser displaying output related to Uvicorn confirming its operation. The overall image demonstrates a basic but functional FastAPI application for managing and querying student data. The comments in the code (using `#`) clearly explain different sections, showing good coding practice.

{"id": "discourse_579556_0", "content": "Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok image 1920×886 45.7 KB I tired multiple times but issue is still there. @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/2/e2d34a628bc87d88e8e28cbb9a08254c16f6ba76.png [Caption] This image shows an error message from the `ngrok` service, a tool used to expose a local web service to the internet. The error, `ERR_NGROK_8012`, indicates that while `ngrok` successfully connected to the local machine (the \"ngrok Agent\"), it could not reach the web service running on that machine (specified as `http://localhost:8080`). The underlying problem is that the connection to port 8080 was refused (`connect: connection refused`). **For students:** This is a common debugging problem. It means that the web server (e.g., a Python web app using Flask or a Node.js app using Express) intended to be exposed through `ngrok` isn't actually running on the local machine at the specified port (8080) or has some configuration problem preventing it from accepting connections. Students working on web projects should check the following: * **Is the web server running?** The student needs to ensure the application is launched and listening on port 8080. This often involves running a command in the terminal (e.g., `python app.py` or `node server.js`). * **Correct port?** Verify the code matches the port number used in the `ngrok` configuration. A mismatch would result in this error. * **Firewall issues?** A firewall on the local machine might be blocking connections to port 8080. * **Port already in use?** Another application may already be using port 8080. The image provides troubleshooting advice for both the developer (checking the local web server) and the visitor (waiting and refreshing). It highlights the importance of understanding the connection flow from the internet (`Internet`), through `ngrok`'s infrastructure (`ngrok Edge` and `ngrok Agent`), to the local web service. The failure point is clearly identified at the final stage, between `ngrok Agent` and `Your Service`. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/2/e2d34a628bc87d88e8e28cbb9a08254c16f6ba76_2_690x318.png [Caption] This image shows a debugging error message from the ngrok tunneling service. In a student context, this would likely appear during a web development project where students are trying to expose a local web server (running on their computer at `http://localhost:8080`) to the internet using ngrok. The error, `ERR_NGROK_8012`, indicates that while ngrok successfully connected to the student's computer, it couldn't connect to the web server running on port 8080. The underlying problem is a `connection refused` error, suggesting the web server isn't running or isn't listening on the specified port. The message provides troubleshooting steps for both the developer (the student): * **Verify the local server:** Make sure the web service (e.g., a Node.js app, Python web server, etc.) is actually running and listening on `http://localhost:8080`. They should try accessing it directly in their browser or using `curl` to confirm. And for a visitor trying to access the publicly exposed ngrok URL: * **Wait and refresh:** If the problem is temporary (e.g., server starting up slowly), waiting and refreshing the page might resolve it. If not, they should contact the developer (student). In essence, this is a common error students encounter when learning to deploy and test web applications, highlighting the importance of verifying the server is running correctly before trying to expose it publicly.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/10", "type": "discourse_post"}

The terminal window also shows network requests and responses, providing details on the API calls being made. * **A web browser:** Showing the assignment instructions in a graded assignment platform (possibly a learning management system). The instructions specify the required functionality (filtering students by class, maintaining order from the CSV file, and enabling CORS). The browser also shows an error response from the API, indicating the student's current implementation isn't entirely correct. The API URL is clearly visible. * **A terminal:** Displays the server logs, showing HTTP requests and responses, which aids in debugging. The log shows successful requests, but also shows \"OPTIONS\" preflight requests which confirm the student is likely working on enabling CORS. In summary, the image captures a student in the process of building and testing a FastAPI application as part of a programming assignment.

In a student context, this might appear during a project involving: * **Web development:** Students setting up a local server and trying to share it with others for testing or demonstration. The error means their local server isn't properly set up to receive and respond to requests. * **Networking/system administration:** Students working with tunneling or exposing services to the internet. The error highlights the crucial connection between the local application and the external access provided by ngrok. Understanding this error helps them troubleshoot network connectivity issues. The image visually represents the flow of traffic from the internet, through ngrok's infrastructure, and to the local service, with a clear indication of the point of failure.

The task involves creating a Python application and deploying it to Vercel. The application needs to expose an API endpoint that accepts two names as query parameters and returns a JSON response containing a list of marks associated with those names. The student has successfully deployed the app (the Vercel URL is visible), however, they're encountering a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error. The error is evident in the Network tab of the browser's developer tools, showing a `CORS Missing Allow Origin` message, indicating that the browser is blocking the request because the origin of the request doesn't match the origin of the API endpoint. The student is also working on setting up a GitHub Action, likely for automated deployment. The status codes 200 indicate successful GET requests, while the 500 shows a server-side error. The image showcases the process of building, deploying, and debugging a web application in a student's context.

The task involves creating a Python application and deploying it to Vercel. The application should have an API endpoint that accepts two names (X and Y) as parameters and returns a JSON response containing the marks for those names. The student is provided with sample JSON data (`{\"marks\": [10, 20]}`) showing the expected output format. The image displays several key parts of the assignment: * **Instructions:** Clear instructions outlining the requirements for creating the Python app, deploying it on Vercel, and building the API. * **Expected Vercel URL:** The student is shown the format for their expected deployed application's URL. * **Error Message:** The student is encountering a `TypeError: NetworkError` indicating a problem connecting to or fetching data from a resource. This suggests a problem with the application's deployment or network connectivity. * **Network Tab (Browser Developer Tools):** The bottom part of the image shows a browser's Network tab, likely from the student's debugging efforts. This tab displays the HTTP requests made by the browser, including requests to `bundle.js` files, suggesting the student is using a frontend framework. The `CORS` (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error (specifically \"CORS Missing Allow Origin\") is visible and is the most likely cause of the `NetworkError`. This error means the application isn't correctly configured to handle requests from different domains. * **GitHub Action (Partial):** The student is also tasked with setting up a GitHub Action (which is a way to automate tasks in a GitHub repository such as building and deploying the code), indicated by the section title \"Create a GitHub Action (1.5 marks)\". In summary, the image captures a student's progress on a web application development assignment, highlighting a common deployment and CORS error during the development process.

This indicates that the student (or possibly one of the students) has received scores of 65 and 74 on two assessments. The context suggests this is a student project related to managing or displaying student marks, likely hosted on Vercel (vercel.app in the URL).

{"id": "discourse_582661_0", "content": "@23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked.

The assignment requires the student to create an API endpoint that returns student data based on class parameters. The instructions specify that a query parameter `class` should filter the results. For instance, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. Multiple classes can be specified, such as `/api?class=1A&class=1B`. The response must maintain the order of students as they appear in the original CSV data. The student also needs to enable CORS to handle requests from any origin. The screenshot displays the API endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`). Below, an error message shows that the API's response doesn't match the expected output (a JSON array of student IDs and their classes). The expected JSON array is shown for reference. Finally, the assignment instructs the student to test their API by adding the `class` parameter to the URL and verifying if the response matches the provided expected data. The student is debugging their code and the error implies that their API is not correctly filtering the student data according to the class parameters.

A student might see this in a context of: * **Computer graphics/Digital imaging:** The options illustrate different methods for optimizing images for web use. \"Resize\" changes dimensions, \"Reduce palette\" limits the number of colors, and \"Compress\" reduces file size. The choices within \"Compress\" allow for lossless (no data lost, larger file) or lossy (some data lost, smaller file) compression, with a slider controlling the level of compression. The \"WebP\" option indicates the output file format. \"Discrete tone image\" and \"Preserve transparent data\" are options relevant to specific image types. The bottom shows the resulting file size reduction (83%) and the final file size (630 B). * **Web development:** Students learning about website optimization would see the importance of image compression for faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage. The options here demonstrate how different compression settings impact file size. * **Computer science:** This panel could be used to illustrate algorithms and data structures involved in image compression. The slider and numerical values illustrate the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. In short, this screenshot provides a practical example of how image optimization is achieved and the choices involved in balancing file size and image quality. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/c/0c8a9ea412f0d3bc7dd073bfb65399ff83e0c22e_2_349x500.png [Caption] This image shows a user interface (UI) for a program that compresses image files. Specifically, it's likely a web-based or application-based image editor with options to reduce file size. For a student, here's a breakdown of the interface: * **Edit:** This is the main header indicating the section where image editing options are located. * **Resize:** A toggle switch (likely on/off) to enable or disable resizing of the image. * **Reduce palette:** Another toggle to reduce the number of colors in the image (useful for lowering file size, especially with PNGs that support many colors). This can make the image less detailed but significantly smaller. * **Compress:** This section focuses on compression techniques. * **OxiPNG:** A dropdown menu showing the selected compression algorithm—likely \"OxiPNG\". This is a specific PNG compression tool known for producing high-quality compressed images. Other options might be available in the dropdown. * **Interlace:** A checkbox that enables or disables interlacing. Interlacing allows for a progressive display of the image while it downloads; the image gradually becomes clearer as more data is received. This is commonly used on the web for a better user experience. * **Effort:** A slider controlling the compression level. Higher effort generally leads to smaller file sizes but increases processing time. * **63%:** Shows the percentage reduction in file size achieved by the selected settings. * **1.41 kB:** Displays the final compressed file size. * **Download Icon:** The blue download button suggests the user is ready to download the compressed image file. In short, this UI allows students to easily adjust the settings (resizing, color reduction, compression strength, and interlacing) to control the trade-off between image quality and file size. It's a user-friendly way to optimize images for web use or to reduce storage space.

Students might encounter this type of interface when working with digital images for projects, presentations, or websites. The UI offers several options: * **Edit:** The main header indicating the section for image editing. * **Resize:** A toggle switch to enable or disable resizing. * **Reduce palette:** A toggle to reduce the number of colors in the image (useful for reducing file size). * **Compress:** A section dedicated to compression settings. * **OxiPNG:** A dropdown menu, likely containing choices for different compression algorithms. * **Interlace:** A checkbox for enabling progressive image loading (the image gradually appears as it downloads). * **Effort:** A slider to adjust the level of compression (higher effort usually means smaller file size but longer processing time). * **Download button:** A prominent button for downloading the compressed image. The bottom of the UI displays the results of the compression settings: a 63% reduction in size, resulting in a file size of 1.41 KB. This type of tool is useful for students needing to optimize images for online use, where smaller file sizes lead to faster loading times and reduced bandwidth consumption. Understanding the different options, especially the trade-off between compression \"effort\" and file size, is important for effective image optimization.

It's likely part of an image editing or file management program. For students, this UI demonstrates several key concepts related to image compression: * **Lossless vs. Lossy Compression:** The \"Lossless\" checkbox indicates a compression method that preserves all image data. The \"Effort\" and \"Slight loss\" sliders represent a trade-off: higher effort leads to more compression (smaller file size), but using the \"Slight Loss\" slider (even at 0) may introduce a small degree of quality reduction. * **File Format:** The \"WebP\" dropdown shows the user choosing a specific file format. WebP is known for its good balance of compression and quality. * **Image Optimization Settings:** Options like \"Resize,\" \"Reduce palette,\" and \"Preserve transparent data\" provide additional controls to minimize file size. \"Reduce palette\" would lower the number of colors, potentially reducing file size but also image quality. * **File Size Reduction:** The bottom bar shows the result of the compression settings: an 83% reduction in the original image size, resulting in a 630 B (bytes) file. In short, this UI provides a visual representation of the parameters and consequences involved in optimizing image files for size without excessive quality loss. It's a good example of how software allows users to make technical decisions about image handling with clear visual feedback.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/85", "type": "discourse_post"}

The task involves building an API endpoint using FastAPI that retrieves student data based on class parameters in the URL. Specifically: * **The Goal:** The student needs to create a FastAPI API that, when given a query parameter `?class=...`, returns a list of students belonging to those classes. Multiple classes can be specified (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`). The order of students in the response should match the order in the source data (presumably a CSV file). * **CORS:** The instructions emphasize the need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from any origin. This is crucial for allowing external applications to access the API. * **API Endpoint:** The student is asked to identify the correct API URL endpoint, likely `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` (a common localhost address). * **Error and Testing:** The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error message indicates a problem with accessing the API during testing. The final instruction suggests the student will test the functionality by sending requests to the API with various `?class=...` parameters and verifying the responses. In short, the image captures a stage in the process of building and testing a simple API for retrieving student data, emphasizing the use of query parameters and CORS configuration.

The instructions explain that the API should filter a list of students based on class parameters in the URL. For example, a URL like `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. Multiple classes can be specified, and the API must return the students in the same order as they appear in the original data file. The student needs to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from any source. The image further displays an attempt to access the API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) which resulted in a \"TypeError: Failed to fetch\" error, indicating a problem with the API setup or request.

{"id": "discourse_586535_0", "content": "@23f1002382 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/e/be3a9cfa13491650ab7a84c59b74fe3a050a30ee.jpeg [Caption] This image is an educational illustration explaining the function of a firewall in computer security. For students, it depicts a firewall as a brick wall (labeled \"Firewall\") that protects a computer (shown as a laptop) from malicious attacks represented by skull and crossbones symbols (\"hackers\"). The figure of a hacker in a black hat symbolizes the threat attempting to breach the firewall. The text \"Firewall Explained\" emphasizes the educational purpose of the image, making it suitable for a lesson on cybersecurity or network security. The visual analogy helps students understand that a firewall acts as a barrier, preventing unauthorized access and protecting the computer system.

On the left, we see a representation of VMs. Each VM is shown as a separate server running its own operating system (like Windows or Linux) and applications (e.g., email, web server, database). They are isolated and require more resources. On the right, the image illustrates containers. Containers share the same operating system kernel but are isolated at the application level. Multiple applications are shown running within the same host OS, making more efficient use of resources. The key difference to highlight is that VMs virtualize the entire operating system, while containers virtualize only the application environment. The \"Animated\" label suggests this is a dynamic visual aid, possibly part of a presentation or video lesson, comparing and contrasting the two technologies. The labels \"VMs\" and \"Containers\" make the comparison explicit and clearly represent each type of virtualization. This visual representation could be used in a class to better understand the practical differences between these two important concepts.

It's aimed at students learning about networking concepts. The main title \"PORTS EXPLAINED ANIMATED\" clearly indicates the topic. A table lists various services (like FTP, SSH, HTTP) along with their corresponding port numbers. This is a key concept in networking – each application uses a specific port number for communication.

{"id": "discourse_586921_0", "content": "image 871×900 40.7 KB Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong? [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/7/371cbe5841fecb6f2b1f1ef4a5341258db49eda3.png [Caption] This Python code implements a simple HTTP handler that serves JSON data based on query parameters. Let's break down its functionality for a student audience: **1. Imports:** The code begins by importing necessary modules: * `json`: For handling JSON data (encoding and decoding). * `os`: For interacting with the operating system, specifically to find the JSON data file. * `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`: A base class from the `http.server` module. This provides the foundation for creating an HTTP server. * `parse_qs`, `urlparse`: From `urllib.parse`, these are used to parse query parameters from a URL. **2. `handler` Class:** This class inherits from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` and defines how the server responds to HTTP requests. **3. `do_GET` Method:** This method handles GET requests. * **CORS Headers:** It sets Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers. CORS allows requests from different domains to access the server's resources. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` line allows requests from any origin, which is generally not recommended for production but is suitable for this example. * **JSON Data Loading:** The code loads JSON data from a file (`q-vercel-python.json`). The path to this file is dynamically determined relative to the script's location. * **Query Parameter Parsing:** It extracts a `name` parameter from the query string of the URL (e.g., `...?name=Alice`). * **Error Handling:** If the `name` parameter is missing, it returns an error message. * **Data Retrieval:** If the `name` parameter is present, it searches the JSON data for entries matching that name and returns their corresponding `marks`. * **JSON Response:** The results (either marks or an error message) are sent back to the client as a JSON response. **4. `do_OPTIONS` Method:** This method handles OPTIONS requests, which are typically preflight requests made by browsers to check if a CORS request is allowed. It sets the necessary CORS headers to enable cross-origin requests. **In summary:** This code demonstrates a basic HTTP server that: * Accepts GET requests. * Loads data from a JSON file. * Processes query parameters. * Returns a JSON response based on the query parameters. * Implements CORS to allow cross-origin requests. This example is useful for illustrating concepts such as: * HTTP request handling. * JSON data processing. * Query parameter parsing. * Error handling. * CORS implementation. It's a good starting point for learning how to build simple web servers that interact with data. A student would benefit from running this code, understanding each part, and perhaps modifying it to handle different data structures or query parameters.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/97", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student learning web development, particularly backend development with Python and FastAPI, would see: * **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** The top line explains the importance of enabling CORS. This is crucial for allowing requests from different origins (like a frontend application running on a separate port or domain) to access the API. A student would learn that if CORS isn't enabled, they'll get errors when trying to access the API from a separate client. * **API Endpoint:** The highlighted URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) is the address of the FastAPI endpoint. This is where the frontend would send requests to get data. Students working with APIs learn that this URL structure is standard. The `127.0.0.1` refers to the local machine, `8000` is the port, and `/api` is the path to the API. * **Error Message:** The \"TypeError: Load failed\" indicates that a request to the API failed. This is a common error in web development, especially when dealing with network requests or APIs. Students are taught debugging techniques to diagnose and solve this. * **Debugging Step:** The final sentence describes a debugging strategy. By adding query parameters (`?class=...`) to the URL, the developer can test specific functionalities of the API and check if the response data matches the expected output. This shows a methodical approach to troubleshooting API problems. In summary, the image captures a typical scenario a student might encounter while building and testing a FastAPI application. It highlights key concepts such as CORS, API endpoints, error handling, and debugging methods.

The screen captures a Google Chrome browser tab (indicated by the Google logo) with a JSON object displayed. The JSON object is a data structure representing a list of students. Each student is an object with two key-value pairs: `\"studentId\"` (a numerical ID) and `\"class\"` (a string representing the class, in this case \"1A\"). This is likely part of a larger assignment or project where the student is working with structured data, perhaps using JavaScript or a similar language. The file name or URL, partially visible in the tab, suggests the project relates to Data Science (likely a course name like \"Tools in Data Science\"). The date in another tab suggests a project deadline. The presence of a file number (127.0.0.1) may refer to an internal ID or version control. In short, the image depicts a common task in introductory data science or programming courses – working with and manipulating structured data using JSON format.

A student might encounter this in a computer science or data science course covering image processing, Python programming, and NumPy. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **Imports:** The code begins by importing necessary libraries: * `numpy` (as `np`): A powerful library for numerical computation in Python, crucial for array manipulation. * `PIL` (Pillow): A library for image manipulation. * `google.colab`: Specific to Google Colab, an online Jupyter Notebook environment, used to upload the image. * `colorsys`: Used for color space conversions (RGB to HLS in this case). * **Image Upload and Opening:** * `uploaded=files.upload()`: This line opens a file upload dialog within the Google Colab environment.

The code specifically aims to determine the number of pixels in an image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219. Here's a breakdown for a student audience: * **Import Statements:** The code begins by importing necessary libraries: * `numpy` (as `np`): For numerical operations, particularly array manipulation. * `PIL` (Pillow): For image processing. * `google.colab`: Suggests this code is running in a Google Colab environment (a Jupyter Notebook-like service in the cloud). This line is used to upload files from the local machine to the Colab environment. * `colorsys`: For color space conversions (RGB to HLS in this case). * **Image Upload and Opening:** * `files.upload()`: A Colab-specific function to upload a file (in this case, `lenna.webp`). * `Image.open(...)`: Opens the uploaded image using Pillow. * **Pixel Processing:** * `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0`: Converts the image into a NumPy array, normalizing pixel values to the range 0-1. * `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(...)`: This is the core image processing step. It uses a lambda function to apply the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function to each pixel. This converts the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values of each pixel into HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) values. It then extracts the Lightness component (`[1]`). * `light_pixels = np.sum(...)`: Counts the number of pixels where the Lightness value is above 0.219. * **Output:** * `print(...)`: Prints the final count of pixels meeting the lightness criteria. * **Result:** The output shows the uploaded image file (`lenna.webp`), its size, and the number of pixels with lightness above the threshold (248985). `lenna.webp` is a standard test image often used in image processing examples. In essence, this code demonstrates a basic image processing task involving color space conversion and pixel-wise analysis. It's a good example of using NumPy for efficient array manipulation within an image processing workflow.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/112", "type": "discourse_post"}

The API endpoint is `/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, suggesting it retrieves data based on multiple class filters (5N, 1T, 11P, and 9W). The response is a list of JSON objects. Each object represents a student, with two key-value pairs: * `\"studentId\"`: A unique numerical identifier for each student. * `\"class\"`: The class the student belongs to (e.g., \"5N\", \"1T\", \"11P\", \"9W\"). In a student context, this data could be used for: * **Class management:** Identifying students in specific classes for attendance tracking, assigning projects, or communication. * **Data analysis:** Examining the distribution of students across different classes. * **Database interaction:** This JSON data likely originated from a database query, demonstrating a common way to retrieve and represent data from a database using an API. * **Programming exercises:** Students could practice parsing this JSON data using programming languages like Python or JavaScript to further manipulate or analyze it. For example, they might count the number of students in each class or create a report summarizing the data. The \"Pretty-print\" label indicates that the JSON is formatted for readability. The original, unformatted JSON would be a single long line, making it much harder to understand.

A student is trying to retrieve data from an API endpoint. * **The API Endpoint:** The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` is identified as the endpoint for accessing the API. This is a common localhost address. * **Expected Data:** The image shows a JSON array containing student IDs and their corresponding classes. This is the expected response the API should return. * **Actual Data vs. Expected Data:** The \"Error\" message indicates that the API's actual response (`undefined`) does not match the expected JSON data. This suggests a problem with the API's functionality or the request being made. * **Debugging Steps:** The final sentence describes the next step in debugging: sending a request to the API with additional query parameters (likely `?class=...`) to filter the results and verify if the API is functioning correctly under specific conditions. In a student context, this image demonstrates common issues encountered when working with APIs: * **Understanding API Endpoints:** Students need to know how to construct and use API URLs. * **JSON Data Handling:** Students must be comfortable interpreting and working with JSON data. * **Debugging Techniques:** The process showcased illustrates a common debugging method comparing expected and actual API responses. * **Query Parameters:** The mention of adding `?class=...` highlights the use of query parameters to refine API requests. The image, therefore, serves as a good illustration of practical API interaction and debugging in a programming course, especially one focusing on web development or backend technologies like FastAPI. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/8/c86362e8fa499ea7995dfa07a8c3498ef81b7e69.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work (likely in a programming class) related to testing an API (Application Programming Interface). **Key elements:** * **API URL:** The student is trying to access an API located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This is a common local address for testing APIs. * **Expected Data:** The image displays a JSON array containing student data (student ID and class). This is the expected output the student anticipates from the API. * **Error:** The student received an error message: \"Response undefined does not match expected [...]\". This indicates the API's response differs from what's expected. * **Testing:** The student plans to refine the API call by adding a query parameter (`?class=...`), likely to filter results by class, and then verify the response. **In summary:** The image captures a debugging scenario where a student is verifying the functionality of an API endpoint, encountering an error, and planning their next steps to troubleshoot. The student is working with JSON data and is likely learning about API testing and debugging.

In a student context, this likely represents data retrieved from a database about students and their classes. * **The URL:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W` indicates a request to a local server (127.0.0.1 is localhost) at port 8000, querying the `/api` endpoint for student information. The query parameters (`class=5N`, etc.) filter the results to include students from classes 5N, 1T, 11P, and 9W. * **The JSON Data:** The `Pretty-print` section displays the formatted JSON response. Each object within the array represents a single student, with `studentId` and `class` as attributes. For example, `{\"studentId\":57,\"class\":\"5N\"}` indicates student with ID 57 is in class 5N. * **Student Context:** This is a common way to represent data about students in a programming or database context. A student might use this data in a program to: * Display a list of students in their class. * Create a student management system. * Generate reports based on class and student IDs. * Conduct data analysis on student demographics (though more data would likely be needed). In essence, the image depicts a simple but fundamental example of how data is structured and retrieved for student-related information in a programming environment. The JSON format is widely used for data exchange between applications.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/114", "type": "discourse_post"}

Vercel is a platform for deploying web applications. For a student, the key takeaways are: * **Deployment:** The application (`api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`) has been successfully deployed (status: Ready). This means the code has been uploaded to a server and is accessible online. * **Domains:** The application is accessible via two domain names: `api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` and `api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app`. This suggests a potential API (Application Programming Interface) and a separate application, possibly for a frontend, are deployed. * **Error:** The \"Not Found\" error indicates that the user tried to access a URL that doesn't exist within this deployed application. This is a common error when the link is mistyped or points to a nonexistent page within the application. * **Logs:** The presence of \"Build Logs\" and \"Runtime Logs\" suggests the possibility to review build processes and runtime information for debugging. * **Version Control (Implied):** The \"View code\" and \"vercel deploy\" options imply the use of version control (e.g., Git) for managing code. In short, the image illustrates a successful deployment on Vercel, but a subsequent attempt to access a specific URL resulted in a \"404 Not Found\" error. This is a common experience during web development and demonstrates the debugging process. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/f/6/f6ae861370f12370cde76d18de318ad1fc622d2d_2_690x330.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a Vercel error message. A student (jivraj-18) is trying to access a web application deployed on Vercel, but is blocked because they lack the necessary team access. The message explains that only members of the specific project team can access this deployment URL. To view the application, the student needs to either request access or log in with a different Vercel account that has the required permissions. This is a common issue in collaborative software development environments where access control is used to manage who can access different parts of a project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/a/ea1a1dadad49d6b6665a2366d0902d4a45122b32_2_690x317.png [Caption] This image shows a Vercel dashboard displaying the deployment details of a web application. For a student, this is relevant to understanding web application deployment and hosting. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Vercel:** This is a platform that hosts and deploys web applications, making them accessible online. Think of it like a simplified version of a server. * **Production Deployment:** This means the application is live and accessible to users. This is the final stage after development and testing. * **`api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`:** This is the unique name Vercel assigned to this specific deployment. It's a long, automatically generated identifier. * **`api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app`:** This is a custom domain name (likely purchased separately) for the same deployment, making the URL more user-friendly. * **Status: Ready:** The application has been successfully deployed and is functional. * **Created:** Shows the date and user who deployed the application. * **`Not Found` error:** This error message in the main window indicates that the specific URL requested by the user does not exist on this deployed application. The student may have entered an incorrect path or the application itself may not be correctly handling routing. * **Build Logs and Runtime Logs:** These are crucial for debugging; they show information about the build process and how the application is running, useful in identifying the reason behind the \"Not Found\" error. They may show errors during the build process or reveal runtime exceptions. * **`>` `_vercel deploy`:** This is a command-line instruction. Students familiar with command line interfaces would recognize it as a common way to deploy an application to Vercel. In summary, the image illustrates a common situation in web development: a successfully deployed application that, however, is displaying an error because of a client-side issue (e.g., a wrongly typed URL) or a problem in the application’s routing configuration. The dashboard provides tools (logs) to diagnose and correct these problems.

The message clearly states that access is restricted because the user isn't a member of the project team. The webpage offers a solution: requesting access to an updated deployment URL or logging in with a different Vercel account that has the necessary permissions. In a student context, this might be encountered in a group project where a student attempts to access a teammate's deployed website without the correct permissions. The student needs to either get added to the team or use a different account to view the project.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/118", "type": "discourse_post"}

The task involves: 1. **Downloading data:** Students need to download a JSON file (`q-vercel-python.json`) containing grades for 100 fictional students. 2. **Creating and deploying an API:** They must create a Python application and deploy it to Vercel (a serverless platform). This app will expose an API endpoint. 3. **API Functionality:** The API should accept GET requests with parameters specifying student names (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/name=X&name=Y`). The API must respond with a JSON object containing the grades for the specified students. An example response is shown: `{\"marks\": [10, 20]}`. 4. **CORS Configuration:** The students must configure their API to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from any origin. 5. **Vercel URL:** The final step is to provide the URL of their deployed Vercel application, which should follow a specific format. The bottom part of the image shows a student's attempt at providing their Vercel URL, but it resulted in a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, suggesting there's a problem with their deployed application or its configuration.

The instructions involve: 1. **Downloading a model file:** The student needs to download a specific file, `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile`, which contains the LLM. 2. **Creating a tunnel:** To access and use the downloaded LLM, the student needs to create a tunnel using a tool called `ngrok`. This makes the LLM accessible over the internet. 3. **Obtaining a ngrok URL:** The `ngrok` tool generates a unique URL, shown in the image as `https://6714-13-71-3-97.ngrok-free.app/`. This URL is then used to interact with the LLM. 4. **Encountering an error:** The student receives an error message stating that the \"Response is too old.\" This indicates a problem with the communication between the student's code and the LLM, possibly due to a timeout or the LLM's internal state. The error message also provides technical details about the LLM's response, including tokens used and the timestamp.

{"id": "discourse_588408_0", "content": "Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input.

The main focus is a code comparison tool displaying two nearly identical JSON arrays. Each array contains multiple objects, each object having a \"class\" and a \"studentId\" property. The subtle differences between the two arrays are highlighted by the tool, though those differences are not clearly visible in the screenshot. The browser tabs suggest the student is working on a web application using a local server (`localhost:8000/api`) and potentially interacting with a remote server (`127.0.0.1:8000/api`). The assignment is likely related to data analysis, JSON manipulation, or programming. The student may be tasked with identifying and/or correcting discrepancies in the data. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/f/0fe131609d98cc3b91359e55e376198f558750c3_2_690x431.jpeg [Caption] The image shows a student's computer screen during a graded assignment. The main window displays a web page titled \"jsondff.com,\" which shows a large JSON diff. The diff appears to compare two JSON objects, likely part of a programming assignment or data analysis task. The browser tabs indicate the student is using tools like Docker Hub and Google, suggesting they're working on a deployed application or interacting with online services for their project. The title \"Graded Assignment\" in the tab bar further emphasizes the context of the task as a graded assignment for an academic setting. The presence of \"Indian Institute of Technology\" in another tab suggests the assignment is part of a course from that institution.

The task is to build an API endpoint that filters a list of students based on their class. The top section presents the assignment instructions: the API should accept a `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`), returning only students belonging to the specified classes, maintaining the original order from the CSV data source. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) needs to be enabled for the API. The middle section shows an error message. The student's API response doesn't match the expected JSON structure of student IDs and classes. The expected JSON data is shown, demonstrating the correct format. The bottom section displays the browser's Network tab. It shows a request the student made to their API (`/api?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z`). The \"Preview\" and \"Response\" sections show the actual data returned, allowing the student to compare it with the expected data to debug their API. The network tab also displays the timing information for the request. In short, the image captures a student actively debugging their API implementation by comparing the received response with the expected output, highlighting a common challenge in web development coursework: handling API requests and data formatting. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/1/31d574850569f527a4038b80d0171d7b685f9348_2_690x431.jpeg [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a graded assignment involving API testing. The assignment requires the student to create an API endpoint that returns student data filtered by class. The top section displays the assignment instructions. The student needs to write an API endpoint that takes class parameters (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`). The API should return only students belonging to those specified classes, maintaining the order from the original CSV file. The student must also enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). The middle section shows an error message. The student's API returned unexpected data compared to the expected output. The expected output is shown as a JSON array of student IDs and their classes. The bottom section displays the Network tab from the browser's developer tools. This shows the API request the student made (`/api?class=1N&class=BN&class=8X&class=42`) and the actual response received from the server. This response is different from the expected response, which explains the error in the middle section. The student is likely debugging their API to match the required functionality. The Network tab provides details on the request, response headers, and timing. In short, the image depicts a student troubleshooting their API implementation in the context of a programming assignment. The discrepancy between the expected and received JSON data highlights a problem the student needs to solve.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/134", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student is asked to provide a Vercel URL, which should follow a specific format (`https://your-app.vercel.app/api`). The student entered `https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api`, but the system returned an error. The error message indicates an unexpected response. The system expected a numerical response (an array of numbers: `[98,92,56,72,17]`), but instead received a status code of 48 and multiple \"Not Found\" errors. This suggests the deployed application at the given URL is not responding correctly or the URL itself is incorrect resulting in a 404 error. The student likely needs to review their deployment process and verify the URL's accuracy to fix the issue. The \"Check\" button suggests a further verification step.

The `?name=Mn&name=m` part suggests parameters are being passed to the API, potentially for filtering or personalization, though the conflicting `name` parameters might indicate a coding error. * **Tabs:** There are multiple tabs open in the browser, suggesting a student might be working on multiple projects: `iitm-tds-project1`, `PROJECT2`, and possibly an assignment related to the Indian Institute of Technology. * **API Response:** The main content shows a JSON response from the API call, formatted using pretty-print. The response is a simple object with a key \"marks\" and a value which is an array of two numbers: `[5, 78]`. This likely represents a student's grades or scores. This could be from a program the student wrote or they are testing an API provided to them. In a student context, this image is likely a screenshot showing a student testing or interacting with an API they developed or are using as part of a class project or assignment.

It's likely a student's project for a Data Science course (\"Diploma Level 1, Term 2, TDS, Week 2\"). The output shows several key pieces of information: * **Application Setup:** The application is watching a specific directory for file changes and is running using Uvicorn with StatReload for automatic reloading. The server process ID is shown. * **Application Startup:** The terminal shows messages indicating successful application startup. * **HTTP Requests:** The bottom section displays a series of incoming HTTP requests. These indicate clients (likely a web browser or testing tool) making requests to the API. Two initial requests (\"/\" and \"/favicon.ico\") result in \"404 Not Found\" errors, meaning the resources were not found on the server. However, subsequent requests to `/api?class=1A` are successful, resulting in \"200 OK\" responses. This suggests the student's API endpoint `/api` (possibly with query parameters) is working correctly, at least for the `class=1A` parameter. In summary, this image provides evidence that the student has successfully set up and launched a FastAPI application and has started testing its functionality. The 404 errors indicate that some aspects of the server setup (like serving static files) might still need attention. The 200 OK responses to `/api?class=1A` show that at least a specific part of their API is functioning. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/a/6a50cc89a7ecf96749fdfd9f965679452c2b3a54.png [Caption] This image shows a student working on a programming assignment involving an API (Application Programming Interface). The assignment requires them to filter a list of students based on class using query parameters in a URL. Specifically: * **The task:** The student needs to build an API endpoint that, given a URL with a `?class=...` parameter (or multiple `&class=...` parameters), returns only the students belonging to the specified classes. The order of students in the returned list must match their order in a source CSV file. * **The API URL:** The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as the API endpoint. This is a common localhost address for development. * **CORS:** The instructions emphasize the importance of enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin. This is crucial for allowing different websites or applications to access the API. * **Error:** The student is encountering a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, indicating a problem with the API request, likely due to a bug in their API implementation or a CORS configuration issue. * **Testing:** The interface allows the student to check their work by sending a test request to the API with various class parameters and verifying if the results match the expected data from the CSV file. In short, this screenshot captures a common scenario in a computer science or software engineering class where students are working with APIs, handling data, and debugging errors. The error message suggests the student needs to address an issue in their code or server setup to make the API functional. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/9/b98ccd9492006221ee5b16d416dfecb71c966e90.png [Caption] This image shows a web browser displaying a JSON response from an API endpoint. The endpoint, `/api?class=1A`, appears to be retrieving data about students in class \"1A\". The JSON data shows a list of students, each identified by a unique `studentId` and all belonging to the same class (\"1A\"). This is likely the result of a query or request to a database or other data source. A student in a computer science or programming class might see this as an example of how data is retrieved and structured in a web application. The \"Pretty-print\" button suggests the data was formatted for easy readability. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a50cc89a7ecf96749fdfd9f965679452c2b3a54_2_690x225.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a programming assignment. The task involves building an API (Application Programming Interface) that retrieves student data. The instructions specify that the API should accept a query parameter called `class`. If this parameter is present, the API should only return data for students belonging to the specified class(es). For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A, and `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return students in both classes 1A and 1B. The order of students in the response must match the original data source (a CSV file). The student needs to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from any origin. The student has entered a proposed API URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) in the provided input field. However, the message \"TypeError: Failed to fetch\" indicates that the API endpoint is not functioning correctly or is unreachable at this point. The \"Check\" button likely submits the URL for testing, verifying the API's response to a query. The overall goal is for the student to implement and test this API functionality.

The API endpoint, visible in the address bar, is `/api?class=1A`. The response is a list of students in class \"1A\", where each student is represented as a JSON object with a `studentId` and a `class` property. The `studentId` values are unique numerical identifiers for each student in the class. This is likely part of a programming or web development exercise related to data retrieval and handling. The \"Pretty-print\" option in the browser likely formats the JSON response for better readability. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/2/b24400365fd76c5cadffeffdfc102b8dd61812be.png [Caption] This image shows a terminal window from a student's computer, likely during a data science class. The student is running a FastAPI application (a Python web framework) on their local machine (port 8000). The terminal output displays several key pieces of information: * **Directory Monitoring:** The application is watching a specific directory on the student's F: drive for file changes, automatically reloading when changes are detected. This is standard practice during development. The directory path indicates a structured course organization. * **Uvicorn Server:** The application is using Uvicorn, a popular ASGI server for Python, to run the FastAPI application. * **Process IDs:** The IDs [18904] and [17712] show the process IDs of the reloader and the main server processes, respectively. This is useful for debugging. * **Server Startup:** The messages show the server starting, waiting for application startup, and completing. * **HTTP Requests:** A series of HTTP requests are shown, with their responses: * Two 404 \"Not Found\" errors for requests to \"/\" and \"/favicon.ico\", indicating that these routes haven't been defined in the application. * Multiple 200 \"OK\" responses for requests to \"/api\" and \"/api?class=1A\", meaning that these endpoints are working correctly. The parameter `class=1A` suggests a possible class-based API. In summary, the image shows the successful running of a simple FastAPI application, along with some common development-related messages (including debugging some missing pages). The student is likely in the process of building and testing their application.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/157", "type": "discourse_post"}

It's relevant to students learning about containerization and deployment. **For a student audience, the explanation would be:** This code demonstrates the process of creating and deploying a simple application (\"py-hello\") packaged as a Docker container. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **`podman login docker.io`**: This command logs into Docker Hub, a registry for storing and sharing Docker images. You need a Docker Hub account (created at `https://hub.docker.com/`) to use this. 2. **`podman build -t py-hello`**: This builds the Docker image from a Dockerfile (not shown, but assumed to exist). `-t py-hello` tags the resulting image as \"py-hello.\" This creates the application container. 3. **`podman run -it py-hello`**: This runs the container interactively (`-it`). This will execute the application within the container. 4. **`podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello`**: This pushes the created image to your Docker Hub account. You must replace `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with your actual Docker Hub username. `py-hello:latest` specifies the image name and tag (latest indicates the most recent version). 5. **`TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG`**: This shows how to push the image with a specific tag (\"dev\" in this example). This is useful for version control and managing different releases of your application. In essence, the commands illustrate a complete workflow for developing, testing, and distributing a containerized application. Students should understand the purpose of each command, the role of Docker Hub, and the significance of tagging images for version management.

It's relevant to a student learning about containerization and deployment. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **`podman login docker.io`**: This command logs the user into Docker Hub, a registry for storing and sharing Docker images. Students need an account on Docker Hub to push their containers. * **`podman build -t py-hello`**: This builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile (not shown). `-t py-hello` tags the image as \"py-hello\", making it easier to refer to later. * **`podman run -it py-hello`**: This runs the newly built \"py-hello\" container in interactive mode (`-i` for interactive, `-t` for a pseudo-TTY). This lets the student test their container locally. * **`podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello`**: This pushes the \"py-hello\" image to the student's Docker Hub repository. `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` needs to be replaced with the student's actual Docker Hub username. `:latest` indicates the latest version of the image. * **`TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG`**: This demonstrates pushing the image with a specific tag (`dev`). This is useful for managing different versions of the container (e.g., development, testing, production). In short, the image provides a practical example of the complete lifecycle of a Docker container: building, running (testing), and deploying to a registry.

A student working on a web development project likely made an AJAX request (an Asynchronous JavaScript and XML request, a common way to fetch data from a server) to `http://google.com`. However, the request was blocked because the server at `http://google.com` didn't include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response. This header is crucial for allowing cross-origin requests – requests from a different domain than the one serving the resource. The error message indicates the request originated from `null`, which usually means the script is running in an environment that doesn't have a proper origin (like a locally served HTML file). The student needs to either modify their code to make the request from a properly configured server, or find an alternative way to access the data from `google.com` that doesn't violate CORS policies.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/160", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break down the code for a student: * **`@app.get(\"/api\")`**: This is a *decorator*. Decorators modify the behavior of functions. In this case, it tells FastAPI that the following function (`api`) should be used to handle GET requests to the `/api` endpoint. If someone makes a GET request to your web server at `/api`, this function will run. * **`def api(...)`**: This defines a function named `api`. This function will process the request and return a response. * **`class_: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None`**: This is the function's parameter. It's a bit complex, showing several Python features: * **`class_`**: This is the parameter name. Note the trailing underscore; this is a common convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords. * **`Annotated[...]`**: This is a type hint, indicating the expected type of the `class_` parameter. It's used for static analysis and documentation, helping developers understand the expected data. * **`list[str]`**: This specifies that `class_` should be a list of strings. * **`| None`**: This uses the union operator (`|`) to indicate that `class_` can also be `None` (meaning no value is provided). * **`Query(alias='class')`**: This comes from FastAPI's Query function. It indicates that this parameter will be extracted from the query parameters of the HTTP request. The `alias='class'` part means that the parameter can be accessed in the query string as `?class=...` (rather than `?class_=...`). * **`= None`**: This sets a default value for the parameter. If no `class` query parameter is provided in the request, `class_` will default to `None`. In essence, this code defines an API endpoint that accepts an optional list of strings (`class`) as a query parameter. The function `api` will then process this parameter (or use the default `None` value if it's not provided) and return some response (not shown in the snippet). The code demonstrates several advanced features of Python, including type hinting, decorators, and using a library (FastAPI) for building web APIs.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/161", "type": "discourse_post"}

In summary, the student is likely facing a challenge in properly displaying their email address on their GitHub Pages website. They are using developer tools to investigate the problem and understand the role of caching and email obfuscation techniques. The image implies a problem-solving context within a web development course or assignment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/4/64798b0686fda7cc36e604c3040f40e2872474b5_2_690x293.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a web development assignment, specifically deploying a website using GitHub Pages. The student is encountering an error. Here's a breakdown for a student audience: * **The Goal:** The student is trying to publish a simple webpage (\"My Model Page\") to GitHub Pages. The intended URL is `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`. * **The Error:** The browser's developer tools show an error indicating that an email address (`24ds1000121@ds.study.uitm.ac.in`) is not found in the response. This suggests a problem with how the email address is being included in the HTML code, possibly due to a JavaScript function used for obfuscation (`cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js`). * **The Code Snippet:** A portion of the HTML source code is displayed, revealing how the student is attempting to protect their email address using obfuscation. This is a common technique to prevent email scraping by bots. * **The Developer Tools:** The screenshot shows the browser's developer tools, specifically the \"Network\" tab, which provides information about the HTTP request made to the GitHub Pages server. The \"Preview\" tab shows the rendered webpage, which is displaying correctly except for the email address issue. * **Cache Busting:** The instruction at the bottom (\"If a recent change...\") suggests a common troubleshooting step: clearing the browser's cache by adding a query parameter like `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL. This forces the browser to fetch a fresh version of the page. * **Overall:** The image illustrates a common problem in web development: deploying a site and troubleshooting issues related to correct code implementation and server-side interactions. The student needs to fix the email display issue and possibly resolve problems with how their email obfuscation is implemented.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/163", "type": "discourse_post"}

The assignment requires building an API endpoint that filters student data based on class parameters passed in the URL query. Specifically: * **The Task:** The student needs to create an API (using FastAPI) that returns student data from a CSV file. The API should accept one or more class parameters (`/api?class=1A&class=1B`). The response should only include students belonging to the specified classes, maintaining the order of students as they appear in the original CSV. The student must also implement CORS to allow requests from any origin. * **The API Endpoint:** The API endpoint is defined as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. * **The Problem:** The student's current implementation has a bug. The error message shows that the API's response doesn't match the expected data. The student will need to debug their code to ensure it correctly filters and orders the student data. * **Debugging:** The student plans to debug by sending requests to the API with different class parameters and comparing the response to the expected data. In short, this is a typical assignment that tests a student's understanding of API design, data filtering, and debugging in a Python programming environment using FastAPI. The error message indicates the student needs to review their data filtering logic. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/4/94b68df3490d735ba6fc0a0f57040bd762ed8eef.png [Caption] The image shows a student's computer screen displaying a JSON response from an API call. The API call, shown in the address bar, is retrieving data about students in class 3Q. The JSON response lists several students, each with a unique `studentId` and the associated `class` (which is consistently \"30\"). This suggests the student is likely working on a programming assignment or project involving data retrieval and manipulation, perhaps in a web development or data science context. The high CPU usage (90%) in the system tray indicates the computer is under significant load, possibly due to the program the student is running or other background processes. The overall context points towards a computer science or related field of study. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/6/a65a73e26776aa7f03943523ae128705930fa05e_2_690x243.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work on an API assignment. The assignment involves creating an API endpoint that returns student data based on class parameters passed in the URL. The top section specifies the requirements: the API should accept a `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`) and return only the students belonging to the specified class(es). Multiple classes can be specified using the `&` operator (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`). The returned data must maintain the order of students as they appear in the original CSV file. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must also be enabled. The middle section shows the student's API URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) and the results of a test. There's an error message indicating that the API's response doesn't match the expected data. The response and expected data are shown in JSON format, listing student IDs and their respective classes. The bottom section describes the next step in debugging: sending another request to the API with the `?class=` parameter to verify the correction of the API. In short, the image captures a snapshot of a student debugging their API implementation, highlighting a mismatch between the expected and actual output, a common challenge in software development. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/c/bc2d0911cafe513e7b673a5c45286d15344a4d33.png [Caption] This image shows a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) representation of student data. In a student context, this could be part of a database or a data structure used in a programming assignment. The data is structured as a list of students. Each student has a unique `studentId` and is associated with a `class`. The `class` value appears to be a code or identifier, not a descriptive class name (e.g., \"Math 101\"). This type of data is commonly used in: * **Database management systems (DBMS):** This JSON could be used to represent data stored in a database, perhaps in a NoSQL database like MongoDB. * **Programming assignments:** Students might be asked to process this data – for example, to sort students by class, calculate the number of students in each class, or search for a specific student. The task might involve working with JSON libraries in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java. * **Web applications:** The data structure is suitable for representing data transferred between a web server and a client (e.g., a web page) in a web application. The sheer volume of data (252 students) suggests a larger-scale application or a more complex assignment than a simple introductory exercise. A student would need to be familiar with JSON syntax, potentially data structures, and possibly database interaction depending on the intended use. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/4/94b68df3490d735ba6fc0a0f57040bd762ed8eef_2_690x387.png [Caption] This image shows a student's computer screen during a programming class. The student is likely working on a web application or API that retrieves and displays data. The screen shows a browser window with a URL (`127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`) indicating a local API call. The browser displays a JSON response, which has been \"pretty-printed\" (formatted for readability) to show a list of students. Each student object has a `studentId` and a `class` property, with the class being consistently \"3Q\" or \"30\". This suggests the student might be working on a project involving student data management or retrieving information about students in specific classes. The high CPU usage (90%) indicates that the student's computer is under a relatively high processing load, possibly due to the application running or other programs running concurrently.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/164", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_591055_0", "content": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/f/6f939856a1a40a564cc355f6fd4a217178902967.jpeg [Caption] This screenshot shows a student's view of an online course module on data sourcing. The course, likely a Data Science or similar subject, is being taken at IIT Madras. The student is currently viewing the \"Data Sourcing\" section, which includes a description of the process, learning resources (PDFs, Notebooks, and videos on the `tabula` and `pandas` packages), and a practical example of real-life web scraping from `emarketer.com`. The instructor, Carlton D'Silva, is visible in a video call window within the module. The student's dock shows various applications, indicating a typical tech-focused learning environment. The overall context points to an online, interactive learning experience with a focus on practical application.

The API call, visible in the address bar, is trying to retrieve information about a ticket's status (presumably a support ticket or similar). The JSON response indicates an error: \"Field required\". This means that the API request was missing a required parameter in its `query` which is indicated in the `loc` field as being `q` or `query`. The `\"type\"` field specifies the error type as `\"missing\"`. The `\"input\"` field shows `null`, confirming that a required parameter was not included. The student is likely learning about API interaction, debugging, or error handling in programming. The use of \"pretty print\" suggests the student is using a tool to format the JSON for easier readability.

The browser's address bar indicates a query sent to a server (likely a local server at address `127.0.0.1:8000`) to check the status of a ticket. The response is displayed in a JSON format in a code editor or console. The JSON response indicates an error: * **\"type\": \"missing\"**: This suggests a required field is missing from the original request sent to the server. * **\"msg\": \"Field required\"**: This confirms the error message, explicitly stating a field is missing. * **\"input\": null**: This shows that the missing field's value is `null` in the server's received request. * **\"loc\": []**: This likely points to the location (in the original query) where the missing field should be. The student is likely working on a programming assignment or project that involves making API requests and handling responses, highlighting a common issue of missing required parameters in API calls. The \"pretty print\" feature in the editor helps visualize the JSON structure, making debugging easier.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/doubts-in-q7-q8/166357/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

The lower section shows \"Recent saves,\" listing three instances where the student saved their progress: on January 27th (score 9.5), January 26th (score 10), and January 26th (score 8.5). Each save shows a timestamp and the score achieved at that point. The \"Reload\" buttons presumably allow the student to revisit these saved sessions. The scores suggest this is likely a quiz or assignment environment.

Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Top Bar (Red):** Shows the time the session ended (Sunday, January 26th, 2025, 11:59 PM IST). This indicates the completion time of the activity. * **Discourse Link (Light Blue):** Offers a link to a discussion forum (\"Discourse\") where students can ask questions or discuss the assignment. * **Login Information:** Confirms the student is logged in using their university email address (22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in), typical of an academic institution's system. A \"Logout\" button is also present. * **Recent Saves (Light Green):** This section displays the student's recent saved progress. It shows three entries: * Each entry includes a \"Reload\" button which likely allows the student to resume the work at that saved point. * The date and time of each save are listed. * The score achieved at the time of each save is also displayed (9.5, 10, and 8.5). This suggests the student worked on the assignment/quiz multiple times. In short, the image provides a record of a student's progress on a graded online activity, along with resources for help and information regarding login and session details. The multiple saves suggest a process of attempting the assignment and making revisions before submission.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-1-submission-not-shown/165396/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

Key details for a student include: * **Assignment Completion:** The assignment ended on January 26th, 2025. * **Resource Use:** Students are explicitly allowed to use any resources, including the internet, AI tools like ChatGPT, and collaboration with others. Even \"hacking\" the code to find answers is permitted. * **Grading:** The time taken to complete the assignment and the final score are factors influencing the grade in the main course (TDS). Completing the assignment in under 2 hours suggests a good chance of success in TDS, and a score above 80% indicates a high likelihood of getting an A or S grade. * **Saving Progress:** The student has saved their progress three times, each time achieving a score of 9.5 out of 10. * **Support:** A link to a discussion forum (\"Discourse\") is provided for students to seek help or clarification. * **Login:** The student is logged in using their university email address. In short, this screen provides the student with feedback on their submission, guidelines regarding the course, and resources for further support.

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements.

{"id": "discourse_588153_0", "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

{"id": "discourse_588155_0", "content": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt .

{"id": "discourse_581700_0", "content": "I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective.

The project had prerequisites that needed to be met before the project itself would be evaluated. These prerequisites involved setting up a GitHub repository with a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that matched the Dockerfile in the repository. The automated grading system checked these prerequisites: * **PASS:** The student's Docker image was present and public on Docker Hub, and their GitHub repository was also present and public. The MIT license was also correctly included. * **FAIL:** The student failed to include a `Dockerfile` in the root of their GitHub repository. Because one of the prerequisites failed, the entire project received a score of 0 and will not be graded until the `Dockerfile` issue is fixed. The email informs the student of these results and the steps needed to correct the problem to proceed with the project evaluation.

The project required the student to meet several prerequisites, all related to setting up a GitHub repository and Docker image. The email details five checks: the existence and public accessibility of a GitHub repository, the presence of a LICENSE file with an MIT license, the presence of a valid Dockerfile in the repository, the public accessibility and runnable state of the Docker image, and finally, that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the repository. The evaluation shows that the student passed four of the five checks. However, the crucial `Dockerfile` check failed; it was not found in the root directory of the student's GitHub repository. As a consequence, the student's project failed the prerequisites, resulting in a score of 0.

The student, \"lakshay654,\" committed the code 2 months ago.

The repository is publicly accessible. The main branch is displayed, along with a list of files and folders. The file list includes: * **`_pycache_`**: A folder containing compiled Python files. This is automatically generated by Python and usually not directly modified. * **`venv`**: A virtual environment folder, used to isolate project dependencies. * **`Dockerfile`**: A file that describes how to build a Docker image for the project. This suggests the project may be designed to run in a container. * **`LICENSE`** and **`MIT LICENSE`**: Files containing the project's license information. The history shows the license was initially created and then renamed to the MIT License. * **`app.py`**: Likely the main application file of the project (written in Python). * **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the project's dependencies. This is a standard way to manage Python project dependencies. * **`test.txt`**: Likely a test file, though the content isn't shown. The right-hand column shows the commit history for each file, indicating the actions performed and when they were done. \"First submission\" likely indicates initial commits and \"Final Submission\" denotes the final version submitted. The fact that the most recent actions were made \"now\" indicates the student is actively working on the project.

However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 —since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png [Caption] This document provides a student with instructions and links to various files related to a project evaluation.

{"id": "discourse_614711_0", "content": "1000004176 1187×446 55 KB Can anyone explain what errors of this sort mean? [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/a/da4e9a282399e03a47410d7ddb796d4a01802f5d.png [Caption] This image shows a server-side error message, specifically an HTTP 500 error. In a student context, this would likely appear during a programming assignment or project involving a web application or API interaction. The error message indicates that a task failed after three attempts, likely related to communication with a Large Language Model (LLM). The root cause is a 401 error (Unauthorized), meaning the authentication token used to access the LLM was invalid or from an unauthorized source. This highlights the importance of proper authentication and authorization when working with external services. The \"Internal server error\" suggests a problem within the server itself, possibly in how it handled the authentication failure. For a student, understanding this error message would involve: * **HTTP Status Codes:** Recognizing HTTP 500 as a general server error and 401 as an authentication error. * **API Interaction:** Understanding the concept of communicating with external services (like LLMs) using API calls and authentication tokens. * **Error Handling:** The message demonstrates the need for robust error handling in code, including retry mechanisms and proper handling of authentication failures. * **Debugging:** This would be a key part of debugging the application; it suggests tracing the authentication process to identify why the token is invalid. * **JSON Structure:** The error message is in JSON format, indicating a common data exchange method in web applications. Students need to be able to read and interpret JSON data. In short, this error message is a valuable learning opportunity for students about the practical challenges of building and deploying applications that rely on external services. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/a/da4e9a282399e03a47410d7ddb796d4a01802f5d_2_690x259.png [Caption] This image shows a JSON-formatted error message, likely from a web server. In a student context, this would be relevant to a computer science or software engineering course covering: * **HTTP Status Codes:** The `HTTP 500` indicates a server-side error. Students would learn that this is a general error, meaning the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. * **Error Handling:** The message details the specific error encountered. The server attempted three times to get a response from an LLM (Large Language Model), but each attempt failed with a 401 error code. This emphasizes the importance of robust error handling in software. * **API Interaction:** The error likely originated from an interaction with an API (Application Programming Interface), possibly a third-party LLM service. This highlights the need for understanding API documentation and handling potential errors from external services. * **Authentication:** The core issue is an authentication failure (`Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer`). Students would learn about the importance of authentication in secure systems and how to properly manage API keys or tokens. * **JSON Data:** The error message is formatted in JSON, a common data format for web APIs. Students should understand JSON syntax and parsing. * **Debugging:** The detailed error message is a valuable tool for debugging. Students would learn techniques for analyzing error messages to identify and resolve problems in their code. In summary, this image provides a real-world example of an error that a student might encounter while developing software that interacts with external APIs or services. It illustrates several key concepts related to error handling, API interaction, and authentication.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/223", "type": "discourse_post"}

This request returned a 500 Internal Server Error. The server's more detailed response indicated the problem stemmed from the task handling process, specifically a failure to obtain an LLM (Large Language Model) response, ultimately resulting in an authentication failure (401 error). The authentication token used was deemed invalid. 2. **Read attempt:** After the formatting failed, a GET request was sent to the same server to read the file. This resulted in a 400 Bad Request error. This suggests that even accessing the file directly failed. 3. **Failure reported:** The entire operation (A2) is marked as failed because of the inability to both format and read the file (`/data/format.md`). **In a student context:** This image would be useful to illustrate: * **HTTP request and response codes:** The student would learn about various HTTP status codes (500, 401, 400) and their meaning in the context of debugging. * **API interaction:** The logs demonstrate how an application interacts with a server (likely a backend service) through API calls. * **Error handling and debugging:** The log is an example of how to troubleshoot errors. The multiple levels of error messages (server error, authentication error) show the importance of examining different levels to find the root cause. * **Authentication issues:** The authentication error highlights the importance of properly configured authentication tokens for accessing resources. * **File system operations:** The attempts to read and write the file show how programming interacts with the file system. The image showcases a real-world scenario of a failed task, highlighting the complexity and importance of debugging and understanding both HTTP status codes and detailed error messages. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a204d9c51d90a584e4e56d593b24821129e056e_2_519x500.png [Caption] This image shows a series of errors encountered while running a task to format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using the `prettier` tool. The errors are presented in a log-like format, typical of what a student might see during a software development or scripting exercise. The log shows: 1. **An attempt to run a formatting task:** The system tried to format the Markdown file using a specific version of `prettier`. 2. **A 500 Internal Server Error:** The initial POST request to the server (localhost:8365) failed with a 500 error. The detailed error message points to a deeper issue: the server's task handling failed due to an authentication problem (401 error). The authentication token used was deemed invalid. 3. **A subsequent GET request failure:** After the initial failure, the system attempted to read the file, resulting in a 400 Bad Request error. This suggests that even accessing the file directly is problematic. 4. **A final failure summary:** The log concludes by stating that the task (`A2`) ultimately failed because the file could not be read. From a student perspective, this log illustrates several important concepts: * **Error handling and debugging:** Students would learn to analyze the different error messages to pinpoint the root cause—in this case, an authentication problem preventing both file formatting and access. * **HTTP request methods:** The log demonstrates the use of POST (for sending data to the server for processing) and GET (for retrieving data). * **HTTP status codes:** The log showcases common HTTP status codes like 500 (Internal Server Error), 401 (Unauthorized), and 400 (Bad Request). Understanding these codes is crucial for troubleshooting. * **API interaction:** The requests show how a client interacts with a server (likely an API) to perform an operation. * **Authentication:** The log highlights the importance of valid authentication tokens for accessing resources. In short, the image provides a realistic example of debugging a complex error involving multiple layers of communication (client, server, and an underlying LLM) that is relevant to students learning about programming, API interaction, and troubleshooting.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/225", "type": "discourse_post"}

At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

The files are: * `_pycache_`: A folder containing compiled Python files. * `data`: A folder likely containing data used by the application. * `.dockerignore`: A file specifying which files and directories should *not* be included in the Docker image. * `.env`: A file containing environment variables. * `Dockerfile`: The file defining the Docker image. * `LICENSE`: The project's license file (MIT license in this case). * `README.md`: A file containing a description of the project. * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`: Python files likely containing the core application logic, data generation, evaluation, and different task functionalities. The commit history shows that the project was created about two months ago, with multiple commits focused on adding application code and setting up the Docker environment. The repository has no description, website, or topics provided yet and has not had any releases or packages published. The programming languages used are primarily Python (98.4%) with a small percentage of Dockerfile (1.6%). This suggests the project is a relatively new and small project that the student is working on.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/248", "type": "discourse_post"}

Here's a breakdown for a student: * **`zakiy7/my-fastapi-app`**: This is the name of the Docker image. The `zakiy7` part is the username or organization on Docker Hub, and `my-fastapi-app` is the name of the application contained within the image. The image likely contains a FastAPI application (a Python web framework). * **`Updated about 1 month ago`**: This indicates the last time the image was updated with new code or changes. * **`Tags`**: Docker images can have multiple tags. `latest` is a common tag, referring to the most recent version of the image. * **`Last pushed about 1 month by zakiy7`**: This confirms the `latest` tag was updated a month ago by the user `zakiy7`. * **`Digest`**: This is a unique cryptographic hash of the image's contents. It ensures the integrity of the image; if the digest changes, the image's content has changed. * **`OS/ARCH`**: This specifies the operating system and architecture the image is built for (Linux/amd64, meaning 64-bit Linux). * **`Last pull`**: This shows when the image was last downloaded. * **`Compressed size`**: This is the size of the image after compression (261.49 MB). * **`docker pull zakiy7/my-fastapi-app:latest`**: This is the command to download (pull) the `latest` version of the image. This command is crucial for deploying the application. **In summary:** The image depicts a publicly available Docker image containing a FastAPI application. Students can learn about Docker images, tagging, versioning, image sizes, and how to download and deploy applications using Docker. This example showcases a typical workflow for deploying applications using containerization.

It details the process of installing several Python packages using a package manager (likely pip). The packages include popular data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and others. The sizes of the downloaded packages are shown in MB. The process is successful in installing 33 packages, but the final line reveals an error: a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This error means the program `app.py` (on line 22) attempts to import a module named `tasksA`, which is not found in the current environment. This is a common error for students learning Python, often due to a typo in the module name, incorrect file path, or forgetting to install the `tasksA` module separately. The student needs to debug `app.py` to find the source of this error and either correct the import statement or install the missing module. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/0/c/0ce93452fedd6a15660a312186ed7f3b3a10a39e_2_690x372.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository for a project named \"tds-project1\". The repository is new, as indicated by the \"Initial commit\" timestamps on all files, and lacks a README file. The project appears to be primarily written in Python (98%), with a small portion in Dockerfile (2%). Several standard files are present: `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE` (indicating an MIT license), `app.py` (likely the main application file), `requirements.txt` (listing project dependencies), and two files named `tasksA.py` and `tasksB.py` (suggesting tasks or subroutines). The repository also lacks any releases or published packages. The absence of a description and the prompt to add a README highlight that the project is in its early stages of development. This is a common view for students working on individual or collaborative coding projects on platforms like GitHub. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/c/0ce93452fedd6a15660a312186ed7f3b3a10a39e.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository for a project named \"tds-project1\". The repository is public and contains several files, including Python scripts (`app.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `requirements.txt` file (likely listing project dependencies), a `Dockerfile` (suggesting containerization is used), and a `.gitignore` file. The project uses Python (98%) and Docker (2%). The repository is relatively new, with only two commits made two months ago by the user GaURaVinDeX. There are no releases or packages published yet, and the project description is missing. A prominent call to action prompts the user to add a README file to explain the project. The structure suggests a student-level project, possibly for a course involving Python programming and containerization. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/6/968890ec5cffbca81bafeef7181db1173e1a6528_2_690x460.png [Caption] This image shows a Python program's output during package installation and execution. A student would see the following key aspects: * **Package Installation:** The top section indicates that several Python packages (libraries) were installed, including `scipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `pydantic-core`, and `duckdb`. The sizes of downloaded packages are shown (in MiB – Megabytes). This suggests the program uses these libraries for data science or numerical computation. `antiorm` and `db` packages suggest database interaction. * **Successful Installation:** The lines starting with \"Built\" and \"Downloaded\" confirm the successful installation of the packages. The final line \"Installed 33 packages...\" summarizes the process. * **Runtime Error:** The bottom section shows a `Traceback` (an error report). The crucial part is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`. This means the program tried to import a module named `tasksA`, but that module doesn't exist in the current Python environment, likely because it wasn't installed or is misspelled. Line 22 of the file `/app/app.py` is where the error occurred. **In a student context, this image highlights:** * **Dependency Management:** Python programs often rely on external packages. This output demonstrates the process of installing and managing these dependencies. * **Error Handling:** The `ModuleNotFoundError` is a common error that students encounter. It teaches the importance of verifying that all necessary modules are installed and correctly referenced. * **Package Versions:** The `==` after the package names (e.g., `antiorm==1.2.1`) shows the specific versions that were installed.

The GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible. 2. The repository must contain a LICENSE file with an MIT license. 3. The repository must have a valid Dockerfile. 4. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via a given command. 5. The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository. The email then presents an evaluation of the student's submission against these prerequisites. While four were met (\"PASS\"), the student failed to include an MIT license in their GitHub repository (\"FAIL\"). Consequently, the project received a score of 0 and will not be evaluated until the missing prerequisite is fulfilled.

The project required the student to meet several pre-requisites, which were automatically checked by the system. These checks included: * **GitHub Repository:** Verifying the existence of a public GitHub repository. * **LICENSE File:** Confirming the presence of a LICENSE file with the MIT license. * **Dockerfile:** Checking for a valid Dockerfile in the repository. * **Docker Image:** Ensuring the Docker image was publicly accessible and runnable. * **Consistency:** Verifying that the Docker image used the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository. The email shows the results of these checks. While the student passed most of the checks (Docker image presence, GitHub repo, Dockerfile), they failed the check for the MIT license in their repository's root directory. Because of this failure to meet the minimum requirements, their Project 1 submission will not be evaluated, and they received a score of 0.

Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply.

{"id": "discourse_615386_0", "content": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton . It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

In summary, the image shows that a test successfully deleted a file via an HTTP request. This could be part of a larger automated testing suite for a software application or a system involving file management and HTTP communication. The URL-encoding in the task parameter shows a good programming practice to handle special characters in file paths in HTTP requests.

For a student, this could represent several things depending on the context: * **Spreadsheet Cell Reference:** `B1` is the cell reference. It indicates the cell located in the second column (B) and the first row (1). The value within that cell is `0`. * **Data Table:** It's a small data table showing a single data point. The \"B1\" might be a label or identifier for the data, and \"0\" is the numerical value associated with it. This could be used in various subjects, like science for recording measurements or in math for demonstrating a variable's value. * **Programming/Coding:** In programming, this could be part of an array or a similar data structure. `B1` could be an index or key, with 0 being the value stored at that location. Without more context (e.g., the surrounding worksheet, a question related to it), it's difficult to give a more specific interpretation. However, the core concepts are cell referencing and data representation. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/3/53a192933345964a58001aea8268e62a2e03e5f0.png [Caption] This image shows the output of a task runner or a similar system. Let's break down what each line means in a student-friendly way: * **`B1 PASSED`**: This indicates that a previous task (labeled \"B1\") has successfully completed. The \"PASSED\" status confirms successful execution. * **`Running task: Delete /data/format.md`**: This shows that a new task is currently running. The task is to delete a file located at the path `/data/format.md`. This is a common command in many operating systems and programming environments. * **`HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\"`**: This line details the HTTP request sent to execute the delete task. Let's break it down further: * **`POST`**: This is the HTTP method used. `POST` is generally used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. In this context, it’s used to submit the delete request. * **`http://localhost:8325/run`**: This is the URL of the server handling the task. `localhost` means the server is running on the same computer. `8325` is the port number the server is listening on, and `/run` is the endpoint that receives the task requests. * **`?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md`**: This is a query parameter appended to the URL. It specifies the task to be executed (\"Delete\") and the file path to be deleted (`/data/format.md`). The `%2F` is URL encoding for the forward slash `/`, needed because the forward slash has a special meaning in URLs. * **`\"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\"`**: This is the server's response to the HTTP request. `HTTP/1.1` specifies the HTTP protocol version. `200 OK` indicates a successful operation – the delete request was processed successfully. In summary, the image depicts the execution of a delete file operation through a web server. The system confirms the successful completion of the previous task, indicates that the delete task is running, and displays the specifics of the HTTP request sent and the successful response received. This is a common way that automated systems, build processes, and testing frameworks might log their operations.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/300", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is likely working on a Python project that involves interacting with an external API (Application Programming Interface). The top part displays the results of two HTTP requests: * **A failed GET request:** The request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` returned a 404 error (\"Not Found\"), indicating the file `/data/c5.txt` could not be located. This suggests a problem with the local file path or server setup. The student received a score of 11/25, suggesting this is part of a graded assignment. * **A successful POST request:** The request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` returned a 200 OK status, meaning it successfully sent data to the API. This likely involves sending text data to a large language model for processing (possibly for embedding generation, which is a technique used in NLP). This API call succeeded. The pop-up window suggests that the student's code editor (likely VS Code) recommends installing the Microsoft Python extension. This extension would enhance the Python development experience within the editor, providing features like improved code completion, linting, and debugging. The \"Chat limit reached\" message at the bottom suggests the student is using a chat-based AI tool or programming assistant, that's reached its usage limit. In summary, the image depicts a common scenario for students working with APIs and large language models where a file access error is encountered but the main API interaction is successful. The student is also prompted to install a helpful extension to improve the coding experience.

The top portion displays the results of HTTP requests, indicating a failure to read a file (\"/data/c5.txt\") resulting in a \"404 NOT FOUND\" error (line 1). A subsequent POST request to an OpenAI API was successful (\"200 OK\"), suggesting interaction with a large language model (LLM) API (line 5-6). A score of 11 out of 25 is visible, possibly related to the assignment's grading (line 4). The lower part shows a pop-up window prompting the student to install a Python extension from Microsoft (the recommended way to work with Python). The taskbar at the bottom indicates the student is using a Windows operating system, and multiple applications are open, suggesting a multi-tasking environment. The 'Chat limit reached' message in the status bar suggests the student might be using a chat-based coding environment or LLM interface. Overall, the image captures a moment in the student's workflow, highlighting both a coding challenge and a prompt to enhance their programming environment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/325", "type": "discourse_post"}

The system is checking for several conditions, each resulting in a pass (1) or fail (0) status. Specifically: * **Docker Repository:** The system checks if a Docker repository exists and is publicly accessible, and that it was created before February 18th. This check passed (1). * **GitHub Repository:** The system checks for a GitHub repository, also verifying it's public and was created before February 18th. This check also passed (1). * **License File:** The system verified the existence of either a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file in the GitHub repository, requiring it to be an MIT license. This check passed (1). * **Dockerfile:** The system checked for the presence of a `Dockerfile` within the GitHub repository. This check failed (0). In short, the student's project is missing a Dockerfile, preventing it from meeting all the prerequisites. The other requirements related to the repositories and licensing were successfully met. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/c/fc6fad6517b25106749f3c9c504cf38cc72bed3c.png [Caption] This image shows a student's output in a programming environment, likely an integrated development environment (IDE) for a coding challenge. The task was to determine whether the phrase \"I hate you\" has a positive or negative connotation and return the answer (\"POSITIVE\" or \"NEGATIVE\") in uppercase to a file named `c5.txt`. The student's attempt failed (indicated by the red and cross icons). The error message \"Server disconnected without sending a response\" indicates a problem connecting to a server, possibly an API endpoint, required to complete the task. This suggests a network connectivity issue or a problem with the server itself, not necessarily a problem with the student's code. Despite the failure, the student achieved a score of 6 out of 25, suggesting they completed some other aspects of the assignment successfully. The bottom section shows the HTTP request made to the server, which returned a \"200 OK\" status code, implying the request itself was successfully sent but the server failed to process it and send back the needed response. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/1/517fe247c71c06f80741f22983662ba012749382.png [Caption] That's a screenshot of a file explorer (likely within an IDE like VS Code) showing a project directory. For a student, here's a breakdown: * **`TDS_PROJECT_1`:** This is the name of the parent folder or project. \"TDS\" likely stands for a course, subject, or team name. The \"_1\" suggests it's the first project in that series. * **`tds-project-1`:** This is a subfolder within the main project folder. Note the lower-case and use of hyphens instead of underscores – this is a common convention for naming things in software development. It likely contains the main code and files for the project. * **`LICENSE`:** This file contains information about the license under which the project's code is distributed (e.g., MIT License, GPL, etc.). The lock icon indicates that it's a specific type of file. This is very important for understanding how the code can be used and shared. * **Icons:** The icons in the top-right corner represent common file operations such as creating new files and folders, refreshing the view, and duplicating files/folders. The green dot likely indicates that the project might be synced with a version control system (like Git) and/or that it's currently active/running. In short, the image depicts a typical structure for a student's software development project within a programming environment. The student is likely working on project number one within their TDS course or team. The presence of a LICENSE file signifies an understanding of software licensing.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/330", "type": "discourse_post"}

From a student's perspective, here are a few ways to describe it: * **For an art class:** The image shows a character rendered in a stylized anime/manga style. Note the use of linework, simplified anatomy (elongated limbs, small head), and limited shading. The color palette is muted, focusing on browns and blacks. The character's pose is dynamic, conveying a sense of weariness or contemplation. * **For a media studies class:** The image is a still from an anime, demonstrating the visual storytelling techniques used in animation. The character's posture and facial expression communicate his emotional state without dialogue. The background is simple, drawing attention to the character. * **For a general discussion:** It's a picture of a seemingly tired or frustrated anime boy sitting against a wall. He looks like he's having a moment of reflection or is dealing with some kind of emotional stress. The image's style is very characteristic of anime and manga. It could be a meme or reaction image because of the character's pose. The watermark \"bandicam.com\" suggests the image may have been captured from a screen recording. The \"imgflip.com\" watermark suggests it might have been edited or shared on that platform. These details could be relevant depending on the context of the discussion.

His large, expressive eyes are wide, and his paws are held together in a gesture of supplication. The word \"PLEASE\" is superimposed on the image, emphasizing his apparent request. The overall effect is one of endearing vulnerability and a clear attempt to elicit sympathy or a desired action. This image could be used to illustrate concepts related to nonverbal communication, character expression in animation, or persuasive techniques.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/333", "type": "discourse_post"}

The log details several attempts to run two tasks: **Task B9:** This task aimed to convert a HTML file from a remote URL and save it locally. The first part (a POST request) succeeded, indicated by a green \"HTTP 200\" response. However, a subsequent GET request to read the locally saved file failed (red \"B9 failed\"), showing a \"Cannot read\" error. This resulted in an overall failure for task B9. **Task B10:** This task aimed to query a CSV file using a datasette server, count rows matching a specific criteria, and save the result. A POST request to the server failed (red \"HTTP 400\"), with a detailed error message indicating a connection problem (\"Failed to establish a new connection\"). A subsequent GET request to read the (non-existent) locally saved file also failed (red \"B10 failed\"). Task B10 also failed. The log ends with a score of 7 out of 20, reflecting the unsuccessful completion of tasks B9 and B10. The final line shows a POST request to a different URL, possibly for a separate part of the evaluation that is not shown in the provided image. The log suggests that the student experienced issues related to file access and database connectivity.

The log details the execution of two tasks (B9 and B10). **Task B9:** This task attempted to convert a GitHub URL to an HTML file and save it locally. The first part of the task (the POST request) succeeded, as indicated by the HTTP 200 status code. However, a subsequent GET request to read the supposedly created file failed (HTTP error), resulting in task B9 being marked as failed because the file could not be read. **Task B10:** This task aimed to use a datasette server to count rows in a CSV file and save the result. The POST request to the datasette server returned an HTTP 400 error (\"Bad Request\"), likely due to a database connection problem. Consequently, the subsequent GET request to read the output file also failed, leading to task B10 being marked as failed. **Overall Score:** The student's overall score for this evaluation was 7 out of 20, reflecting the failures of both tasks. The log shows HTTP requests and responses, indicating a likely problem with either the server connection or file paths, preventing successful task completion. This detailed log is useful for debugging and understanding why the tasks failed.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/335", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break down the information: * **`C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt` and `X C5 FAILED`**: This indicates an error. The program (presumably labeled \"C5\") failed to read a file named `c5.txt` located in a `/data` directory. This suggests a file path issue, the file might not exist, or there are permissions problems preventing access. * **`HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt \"HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\"`**: This shows an HTTP GET request was made to a local server (localhost:8000) to retrieve `c5.txt`. The `404 Not Found` response confirms the server couldn't find the requested file, which corroborates the previous error. * **`Score: 7 / 25`**: This is likely a progress indicator or a test score for the project. The student achieved 7 points out of a possible 25. * **`HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.2 200 OK\"`**: This shows a successful HTTP POST request to a remote server (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev`), likely an API call to an OpenAI service (indicated by `/openai/v1/embeddings`). This suggests the student is using an external service for embeddings, probably related to Natural Language Processing or machine learning. The `200 OK` response indicates this request succeeded. * **`PS C:\\Users\\choud\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tds1\\TDS_Project_1>`**: This shows the current working directory of the PowerShell command prompt (PS) in the student's OneDrive folder where their project is stored. In summary, the image displays the output of a student's program which encountered a file reading error but successfully made an API call to an external service. The error with `c5.txt` needs to be addressed. The student's score suggests they've completed part of their project. The successful API call implies the student is working with external services within their project.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/336", "type": "discourse_post"}

For a student, here's a breakdown: * **TAG:** `version1` indicates this is a specific version of the Docker image. Think of it like a software version number (e.g., v1.0, v2.0). * **Last pushed:** This shows the image was last updated about a month ago by a user named `abhay227`. This is important for knowing how current the software within the image is. Outdated images might have security vulnerabilities. * **Digest:** `4db729a03174` is a unique fingerprint of the image's content. This ensures that you're downloading the correct version and that it hasn't been tampered with. * **OS/ARCH:** `linux/amd64` specifies the operating system (Linux) and processor architecture (64-bit AMD) for which this image is built. It won't run on other systems like macOS or ARM-based processors without modification. * **Last pull:** This indicates when someone last downloaded this image. This is different from \"last pushed\"; it shows image usage. * **Compressed size:** 261.98 MB is the size of the downloaded image file. This is important to consider for storage space and download time. * **`docker pull abhay227/tds_project:version1`:** This is the command a student would use in a terminal to download this specific Docker image. The command shows how to obtain the image. `abhay227` is the username, `tds_project` is the project name, and `version1` is the tag specifying the image version. In short, this image provides metadata about a Docker container, crucial information for students learning about Docker and containerization. It demonstrates how to identify, locate and download a specific version of a containerized application.

The log details several attempts to perform different operations, such as: * **Converting a README file to HTML:** The student tried to convert a README file from a GitHub repository into HTML format and save it locally. This task initially succeeded (B9 task executed successfully). However, subsequent attempts to read the saved HTML file failed (B9 failed: Cannot read `/data/b9.html`), indicating a file path or access issue. * **Querying a database:** The student attempted to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`) to count the number of rows where a column named 'type' equals \"Bronze\". This involved running a datasette server, making an HTTP request to retrieve data, and then saving the results to a CSV file. This attempt failed (B10 failed: Cannot read `/data/b10.csv`), showing a `400 Bad Request` error and a connection refusal error. This suggests problems with the database connection or server setup. * **Embedding Generation:** The log shows a successful POST request to an embedding service (likely for NLP tasks). This part of the assignment appears to have worked correctly. The log entries are marked with red 'X' indicating failures and yellow circles indicating successful tasks (some partially successful with failures later on). The student's final score is 8 out of 20, reflecting the numerous failures in their code. The errors indicate several potential problems: file path errors, database connection issues, and possibly server configuration problems. The student needs to debug these issues to improve their program.

The log details the execution of several HTTP requests as part of an automated task. The tasks involve: * **Converting data:** Fetching HTML content from a remote URL and saving it locally as HTML files. Some of these conversions succeeded (indicated by green \"200 OK\"), while others failed (red \"FAILED\"). * **Running a datasette server:** Launching a server locally to process data, specifically counting rows meeting certain criteria from a CSV file (\"ticket-sales\"). This task also encountered errors. The specific error messages suggest problems establishing connections to the database or server (e.g., \"Connection refused\"). * **Reading data:** Attempting to read data from local files (`.html` and `.csv`). These attempts resulted in \"404 Not Found\" errors, implying that the files were not found at the expected locations. The log provides a record of the individual tasks, their status (success or failure), and any error messages. The failures highlight potential issues in the student's code, such as incorrect file paths, network connectivity problems, or server-side errors. The overall score (\"Score: 8 / 20\") suggests the student's automated process is incomplete and needs debugging.

They are looking at their \"Downloads\" folder. A file named \"231001524-docker_logs.zip\" is visible in the address bar, indicating this file is the focus. However, a search bar at the top shows \"231001524\" is typed in the search field, and the results show \"No items match your search\". This suggests that the file is not found when searching by its numerical prefix, possibly due to a naming convention issue or the search not being case-sensitive. The \".zip\" extension indicates it's a compressed archive file probably containing log files related to Docker. The student is likely trying to locate this file, potentially for troubleshooting or analysis related to a Docker project.

The window is open to the \"Downloads\" folder. A zipped file named \"evaluation_logs.zip\" is present in the Downloads folder, but it appears to be empty or contains no items that match the search criteria. The student likely downloaded this file, potentially containing log files for an evaluation or assessment. The file explorer shows common folders like Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos. The \"No items match your search\" message indicates that a search was performed within the \"evaluation_logs.zip\" archive, yielding no results. The student may need to investigate why the zip file is empty or try a different search term. The folder structure suggests an organized file management system on the student's computer.

The report breaks down the score into several components: * **Pre-requisites:** The student successfully fulfilled all pre-requisite checks, including having public GitHub and Docker repositories with the correct files and timestamps. Each check is marked with a \"1\" indicating success. * **Task Score:** The student received a score of 0 on the main project tasks. * **Bonus:** The student earned 1 bonus point. * **Total Score:** The final score is 1 (the minimum of 20 and (0 + 1)). * **Logs:** The email indicates that the student will receive both Docker and evaluation logs because they met the prerequisites. If the API service didn't start within 5 minutes, only the Docker log would have been included. The table with A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5 likely represents individual task scores within the project, where each cell value of 0 indicates that section was not completed successfully. The email suggests that the student's task score was composed of these individual scores, summing up to a final task score of 0. The specific meaning of A, B, and C sections is not explained in the provided image.

The student is looking at their \"Downloads\" folder. A zipped file named \"evaluation_logs.zip\" is highlighted, but the folder is otherwise empty. The \"No items match your search\" message indicates a search was performed with no results. This suggests the student might be looking for something specific within the zip file, or within the Downloads folder more generally. The presence of other folders like \"Documents,\" \"Pictures,\" etc., indicates a typical file organization for a student's computer. The file name suggests the zip file might contain evaluation logs, potentially for a school assignment or project.

The window is displaying the \"Downloads\" folder. A zipped file named \"23f1001524 - docker_logs.zip\" is highlighted in the address bar, indicating the user is currently looking at this file. The search bar at the top shows a search for \"23f1001524\", but no files matching this search term are found in the \"Downloads\" folder. The file explorer's side bar shows other folders like \"Documents\", \"Pictures\", \"Music\", and other folders unique to this user. The \"Extract all\" button suggests this is a compressed file containing other files or folders within.

The sheet is titled \"p1_evaluation_error_logs\" and lists numerous error messages associated with student submissions (indicated by email addresses in the first column). Many errors report missing modules (e.g., \"taskA module missing,\" \"flask module missing\"), suggesting problems with software dependencies or installation. One significant error indicates that a Docker container port is inaccessible due to incorrect network configuration (bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`). Other errors include a missing file (\"env file missing\") and an application running on an unexpected port (5000). The sheet is likely used for tracking and diagnosing issues encountered during the evaluation of student projects, helping to identify common problems and streamline the debugging process. The \"View only\" setting suggests that the sheet is shared with students and/or teaching staff for viewing but not editing. The large number of similar errors (\"taskA module missing\") suggests a common problem that needs to be addressed in the project instructions or support materials.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/348", "type": "discourse_post"}

Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone cd I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email= --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

The spreadsheet is titled \"p1_evaluation_error_logs,\" suggesting it's related to the evaluation of a first project (p1). The two main columns are \"email\" and \"error_reason.\" The \"email\" column lists student email addresses, each associated with a specific error encountered during the project's evaluation. The \"error_reason\" column details the nature of the error. Many errors are related to missing modules (e.g., \"taskA module missing,\" \"requests module missing\"), indicating problems with the project's dependencies or installation. Other errors point to configuration issues (e.g., application running on a specific port, incorrect file paths, Docker container port accessibility). The spreadsheet provides a record of the errors encountered by various students, allowing instructors or graders to identify common issues and provide targeted feedback or assistance. The sheer number of errors suggests a widespread problem with the project setup or dependencies that may require additional guidance for the students. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/f/afbded56c295f1e2ff28878559e430ba3ed8244e_2_690x384.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a student's submission for a programming assignment. The assignment involved creating a Docker image and hosting it on both GitHub and a Docker registry. The top section shows the links to the submitted repositories. The \"Pre-requisites check\" section indicates that the student successfully met all the necessary conditions: the Docker and GitHub repositories existed, were public, and contained the required files (LICENSE and Dockerfile). Each condition is marked with a \"1\" indicating success. The table below shows the student's performance on different parts of the assignment (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5). All entries are \"0,\" indicating that the student did not achieve points in these sections of the evaluation. This might be due to the API service not starting successfully within the 5-minute time limit, as noted at the bottom of the image. The final section displays the scores: a task score of 0, a bonus score of 1, and a P1 score of 1. The bonus and P1 scores likely correspond to the successfully met pre-requisites. The lack of a task score suggests that the core functionality of the API was not met. The student will receive the docker logs, and because the pre-requisites were met, also the evaluation logs. However, the zero in the task score and the explanation at the bottom imply that the API service failed to start within the 5-minute limit. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/f/afbded56c295f1e2ff28878559e430ba3ed8244e.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a student's submission for a programming assignment. The top section shows the GitHub and Docker repositories submitted. The \"Pre-requisites check\" section indicates that all pre-requisites were met (each item shows a score of 1). The table below contains the student's scores for different parts of the assignment (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5). All the scores in the table are 0, indicating the student did not receive points for these sections. The final section shows the overall scores: a task score of 0, a bonus score of 1, and a P1 score of 1. The accompanying text explains that evaluation logs (detailed feedback) are only included if the API service started within 5 minutes; otherwise, only Docker logs (basic logs about the container's operation) are provided. Because the student's task score is 0, it is likely their API service failed to start within the required time. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/2/c2b0b8d98d14050bb8021568b7a3ac7101c7e4df_2_690x351.png [Caption] This image shows a spreadsheet containing error logs from a student project evaluation. The spreadsheet lists student email addresses in one column and the corresponding error messages encountered during the evaluation in another. Many of the errors are related to missing modules (e.g., \"requests module missing,\" \"taskA module missing,\" \"flask cors module missing\"), indicating problems with the students' code dependencies or installation. Other errors point to configuration issues such as a application running on port 5000 (port conflict) or problems with file paths (\"No such file or directory\"). One error message explicitly mentions a Docker container port not being accessible, suggesting a problem with container configuration. The sheer number of similar error messages suggests a common issue in the students' setup or code. The timestamp suggests this is from a batch evaluation. This data would be useful for identifying common problems and providing feedback to students to improve their code and project setup. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d694d88bee053086a294de30c7566ea08dbbf9c0.png [Caption] Here's a description of the image in a student context: The image shows a file explorer window on a computer, likely Windows. The user is in the \"Downloads\" folder and has searched for a file named \"evaluation_logs.zip.\" The search returned no results, indicated by the message \"No items match your search.\" This suggests that either the file is not in the Downloads folder or the search terms were incorrect. The \"evaluation_logs.zip\" file is a compressed file (likely a zip archive), indicated by the \".zip\" extension. The window also displays information columns for file name, type, size, and any potential password protection. The file ID 23f2001390 might be a unique identifier associated with the file. The student might be experiencing difficulty locating a necessary file for an assignment or project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/1/41513a69b4af93110ad5c7a3717fca9f0fecd63b.png [Caption] This is a screenshot of a Windows file explorer window. A student might see this if they're working with files and folders. The window shows the \"Downloads\" folder, where a file named \"docker_logs.zip\" has been located. However, the file explorer is currently empty; it displays the message \"No items match your search.\" This suggests the student may have searched for something within the zip file, but nothing was found, or they haven't yet extracted the contents of the `.zip` file. The search bar at the top right contains a search term or file name (23f2001390), possibly related to the files inside the zip. The presence of a \"Password p...\" column suggests the zip file may be password-protected. The overall context implies a student might be working on a project involving Docker and is currently trying to access the contents of a log file. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/1/41513a69b4af93110ad5c7a3717fca9f0fecd63b_2_690x327.png [Caption] This image shows a Windows file explorer window. A search has been performed for \"23f2001390\" within the \"docker_logs.zip\" archive file located in the \"Downloads\" folder. The search returned \"No items match your search,\" indicating that the string \"23f2001390\" was not found within the compressed files inside the `.zip`. The user is likely trying to locate a specific file or piece of data within the archive. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/6/d694d88bee053086a294de30c7566ea08dbbf9c0_2_690x336.png [Caption] Here's a description of the image in a student context: The image shows a Windows file explorer window displaying the contents of a compressed zip file named \"evaluation_logs.zip\" located in the \"Downloads\" folder. The search bar at the top shows a search was performed (likely for files within the zip), resulting in the message \"No items match your search.\" This indicates that the archive is either empty or the search terms were incorrect. The window also displays columns for \"Name,\" \"Type,\" \"Compressed size,\" and a partially visible \"Password\" column. The right-hand pane shows a message instructing the user to \"Select a file to preview,\" further reinforcing that the archive's contents are not visible without additional action. The file size is shown as 23f2001390 bytes. This is likely a student's view; maybe they're trying to access data files for an assignment or project. The fact that the search yielded no results suggests a potential problem – maybe the correct file wasn't downloaded or the file is password-protected. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/f/2fa3b5ca794441978a80d9d1c4e4c850eb67304c.png [Caption] This image shows a student's log of a programming assignment involving data extraction and analysis. The student used a tool called `datasette` to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`) and save the results to a CSV file. The log shows several HTTP requests: * **Failed Attempts:** Multiple attempts to access data files (`/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`) failed with `404 Not Found` errors. This indicates that the files were not found at the specified locations. A `400 Bad Request` error also occurred during a POST request, suggesting an issue with the request format or parameters. A connection error (`[Errno 111] Connection refused`) suggests the database server wasn't accessible at the time of the request. * **Successful Request:** A POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` succeeded with a `200 OK` response. This likely indicates a successful interaction with an external API, possibly for further data processing or embedding generation. * **Assignment Task:** The log clearly states the assignment: to count the number of \"Bronze\" entries in the `tickets` table of the database and save the count to a CSV file. * **Score:** The student received a score of 7/20, suggesting significant problems were encountered during the execution of the assignment. The low score is likely due to the failed HTTP requests and inability to correctly retrieve and process the data. In summary, the image provides a detailed record of a student's struggles during a data processing assignment, highlighting the challenges of connecting to and accessing data sources, and demonstrates the use of HTTP requests and error handling in a programming context. The `404` and connection errors point to problems with file paths, server accessibility, or network configuration.

The log details several HTTP requests made during the execution of a program, likely involving a database interaction. Specifically, the log shows attempts to: * **Run a datasette server:** The student is trying to run a database server (likely `datasette`) in the background to query a database named `ticket-sales.db`. * **Query the database:** The student is attempting to query the database to count the number of rows where the 'type' column equals 'Bronze', saving the result to a CSV file (`/data/b10.csv`). Multiple attempts are indicated, with several failures. * **Read the CSV file:** The program then attempts to read the newly created `b10.csv` file. * **Interact with an external API:** The log shows a successful POST request to an API endpoint (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`), possibly for embedding generation or other external processing. **Errors encountered:** The log contains several errors: * **Connection Refused:** The database server failed to establish a connection, indicating a network or server configuration issue (Error 111). * **400 Bad Request:** The initial request to the database server received a 400 error, suggesting a problem with the request itself, possibly a malformed URL or incorrect parameters. * **404 Not Found:** The attempt to read `/data/b10.csv` resulted in a 404 error, meaning the file was not found at the specified location. This likely stemmed from the previous database query failures. **Overall:** The log suggests the student encountered problems connecting to or querying their database, leading to the failure of subsequent steps in their program. The final successful API call is likely unrelated to this earlier database interaction. The score of 7/20 indicates the assignment wasn't completed successfully due to these errors. The student needs to troubleshoot their database connection and query parameters to resolve the issues.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/355", "type": "discourse_post"}

The log appears to be related to a student project (\"ds.study.itm.ac.in\" suggests a university domain). Each row represents an error, including: * **Timestamp and Email:** Identifying when and by whom the error occurred. * **Error Description:** The error message itself. Common errors include missing modules (like `taskA`, `pydub`, `flask`), import errors, and issues with Docker container port binding (port 8000 not accessible outside the host). One error mentions an unterminated string literal, a common programming error. * **Python Version Incompatibility:** A final error indicates that the software is incompatible with the student's Python version (3.12.9), requiring versions 3.6 or 3.10. The sheer number of similar errors (especially the repeated missing module errors) suggests a systematic problem, possibly related to the project's setup or dependencies, rather than individual coding mistakes. The Docker port-binding issue points to a configuration problem external to the code itself. A student reviewing this log would need to systematically address each error, likely by debugging their code, correcting the Docker configuration, and/or installing the correct Python version and modules. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/e/9e2ca0680b13a927d524fe5883919c8447d0f8e3.png [Caption] This image shows a spreadsheet of error logs from a student's programming project. The spreadsheet appears to be a Google Sheet or similar program. Each row represents a different error encountered during the execution of the student's code. The first column shows a unique identifier (possibly a student ID or timestamp) for each error. The second column shows the student's email address, suggesting this is a shared document among students or with a professor. The third column describes the specific error encountered, such as missing modules (`taskA`, `pydub`, `flask`), inability to import modules, or problems with the Docker container's port mapping (the container is bound to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`, preventing external access). There are also errors relating to specific libraries and Python version incompatibility. The large number of similar errors (many instances of missing modules) suggests a systematic problem in the project's setup or dependencies rather than isolated coding mistakes. The Docker port binding issue points to a configuration problem external to the code itself. The final error highlights that the student is using a Python version that is incompatible with the project's requirements. In short, this spreadsheet provides a detailed record of errors encountered by a student during software development, revealing both coding and environment-related issues. The information is valuable for debugging and understanding the root causes of the problems.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/357", "type": "discourse_post"}

This might be a preliminary step unrelated to the main task. * **Database connection issues:** The core of the log shows repeated failures when attempting to connect to the `ticket-sales.db` database running locally on port 8001. The errors indicate that the maximum number of connection retries was exceeded (HTTP 400 Bad Request and HTTP 404 Not Found errors). This likely means the database server wasn't running properly or the student had a firewall or network configuration issue preventing connection. The error message specifically mentions `Connection refused`, which is a strong indicator of a network problem. * **Successful API call:** At the end, there's a successful POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This suggests that the student was able to connect to a remote API, separate from the local database issues. This might be for a different part of their assignment. In summary, the log demonstrates a debugging process where a student is encountering and attempting to resolve connectivity problems between their code and a local database. The successful API call indicates that at least one other part of their system is functioning correctly. The final score of 7/20 further suggests this was part of a graded assignment with significant penalties for the database connection failures.

The log displays multiple HTTP requests and their responses. The student is attempting to use the `datasette` tool to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`), count rows based on a condition (`type` equals \"Bronze\"), and save the result to a CSV file. The log reveals several errors: * **B9 FAILED:** The initial attempt to read a local HTML file (`/data/b9.html`) failed. This is likely unrelated to the core task but suggests a problem with file access or paths. * **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** The main task, querying the database using `datasette`, resulted in a 400 error. The detailed error message indicates that the server (localhost:8001) couldn't establish a connection to the database, possibly due to a connection refusal or server misconfiguration. This is the critical error hindering the task's success. * **B10 FAILED:** A subsequent attempt to read the output CSV file (`/data/b10.csv`) also failed, likely because the previous database query failed to generate this file. This is a consequence of the earlier error. Finally, there's a successful `POST` request to a remote API (`aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`), which suggests that the student may be using external services for embedding generation. This is likely a separate part of the project, and not directly related to the database querying problems. The student's score of 7/20 indicates that this part of the assignment was not completed successfully. The errors point to issues with database connectivity and potentially incorrect file paths. The student needs to troubleshoot the database connection and ensure the correct configuration of `datasette` and the server.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/379", "type": "discourse_post"}

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course.

The student is running a task that analyzes the sentiment of the phrase \"I hate you\". The code attempts to send a POST request to a server (possibly a local server at `http://localhost:8000`) to perform this analysis. The server should return \"NEGATIVE\" and save it to a file named `c5.txt`. However, the POST request fails (C4 FAILED) due to a \"No connection adapters were found\" error, indicating a problem with the server-side configuration or network connectivity. Despite this failure, a GET request successfully retrieves the content of `c5.txt` (which contains \"NEGATIVE\"), leading to the passing of test C5. The overall score is 6 out of 25, suggesting that the assignment involves multiple tasks, and only some have been completed successfully. The student is using a tool (likely a Python-based framework given the `.py` files) which interacts with a local server and potentially an external API (`https://aiproxy...`) for embedding generation. The file structure visible shows common project files: `.env` (environment variables), `app.py` (main application logic), `datagen.py` (data generation), `Dockerfile` (containerization), `evaluate.py` (evaluation/testing). The existence of `tasksA.py` and `tasksB.py` indicates the assignment is comprised of several sub-tasks. The low score suggests the student needs to resolve the connection issue and complete other parts of the assignment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f6ef64ca044db4f86e841615328f2f0015d6df1.png [Caption] This image shows a student's Jupyter Notebook or similar IDE, likely used for a programming assignment. The student is working with a Python script (`evaluate.py`) that interacts with a server (possibly for a course project or challenge). Several key things are evident: * **Environment Setup:** The file explorer shows a `.env` file, suggesting environment variables are being used (possibly API keys or credentials). There's also a `datagen.py` file, possibly containing data generation code. * **Task Execution:** The terminal shows the execution of a command, `uv run evaluate.py`, which appears to run a script using a specific tool (`uv`). This script interacts with a remote server (`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/...`) using an email and token for authentication. * **HTTP Requests and Responses:** The output shows HTTP requests (POST and GET) made to a local server (`localhost:8000`). There's a 400 Bad Request error related to a missing `HTTPException`, indicating a problem with the server-side code or the request's format. A subsequent GET request is successful. * **File Handling:** A task involves processing a date file (`/data/datefile.txt`) to count Thursdays and write the count to another file (`/data/dates-thursdays.txt`). This shows the student is performing data processing or manipulation. * **Error Handling:** The student encounters a `[WinError 2]` error, which is a common file not found error, suggesting a path issue or missing file. * **Automated Testing (possibly):** The presence of `A1 PASSED` and `A2 FAILED` suggests some form of automated testing is in place, likely part of the assignment's evaluation. Overall, the image depicts a student tackling a programming assignment that involves server interaction, data processing, and potentially testing. The errors indicate some debugging is required. The assignment seems to be designed to test their understanding of several concepts, including API calls, data manipulation, file I/O, and error handling. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/4/7451ed8873f25e16cf269a59e4ba5daeba424dc2.png [Caption] This image shows a Python file named `evaluate.py` opened in a code editor. The file begins by specifying the required Python version (>=3.13) and listing its dependencies (libraries it needs), including `faker`, `httpx`, `lxml`, `numpy`, `pillow`, and `python-dateutil`. The code then imports various Python modules such as `sys`, `hashlib`, `httpx`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `re`, and `subprocess`. It also imports the `parse` function from `dateutil.parser` and several functions (`get_markdown`, `get_dates`, etc.) from a custom module named `datagen`. Further down, it imports `fromstring` from `lxml.html` and `Image` from `PIL`. Finally, the code shows API keys (`openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key`) which are likely used to interact with OpenAI and Gemini APIs. The file's structure suggests it's part of a larger project, potentially involving data generation, parsing, and interaction with external APIs. The project folder structure in the left-hand panel shows other related Python files, a `Dockerfile`, a `LICENSE` file, and a `README.md` file, all typical of a software project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/4/7451ed8873f25e16cf269a59e4ba5daeba424dc2_2_378x499.png [Caption] This image shows a student's Python code editor, specifically the `evaluate.py` file within a larger project called `Ilmagent`. The code is structured as follows: 1. **Header:** The header clearly specifies the Python version requirement (`requires-python = \">=3.13\"`) and lists external libraries used (`dependencies`). These include common libraries for data generation, HTTP requests, XML parsing, image manipulation, and date/time handling. 2. **Imports:** The code imports various Python modules, indicating the tasks it will perform. These include standard libraries like `sys`, `hashlib`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `os`, `random`, and `re`, as well as external libraries previously listed in the header (like `numpy`, `httpx`, and `dateutil`). Importantly, it imports several functions (`get_markdown`, `get_dates`, etc.) from a file named `datagen.py`, suggesting this file contains data generation functions. Finally, it imports `fromstring` from `lxml.html` (for HTML parsing) and `Image` from `PIL` (for image processing). 3. **API Keys:** At the end, we see API keys for OpenAI and Gemini. This strongly suggests the code interacts with these AI services for some purpose. 4. **File Structure:** The left-hand panel shows the project's file structure, with several files indicating a larger program related to data generation (`datagen.py`), possibly an application (`app.py`), and various supporting files (like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`). This suggests a more comprehensive project, and `evaluate.py` is likely a crucial component for running the program or evaluating results. In summary, the image depicts a Python program designed to use various data sources, process data (potentially with AI assistance), and possibly manipulate images, which suggests this is a relatively advanced project likely undertaken as part of a data science or AI-related course. The project's organization and the use of external libraries and API keys hint at a sophisticated application.

The student is building a Docker image for their project, which appears to be a web application using the FastAPI framework. The left pane displays the project files: `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. `app.py` contains commented-out lines listing project dependencies, including `requests`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dateutil`, `pandas`, `db-sqlite3`, `scipy`, `pybase64`, and `python-dotenv`. This suggests a fairly standard data science or machine learning project setup. The main pane shows the terminal output of the `docker build` command. The output details the steps Docker is taking to build the image, including downloading base images, installing dependencies (using `apt-get` and `pip`), copying files, and finally creating and tagging the image. The successful completion of the build is indicated by `[+] Building 5.9s (15/15) FINISHED`. The image is tagged as `llm-agent`, hinting at the application's purpose. The use of `docker build` and a `Dockerfile` demonstrates good software engineering practices for reproducibility and deployment. The terminal also shows the student is using PowerShell on a Windows machine. The right pane shows a Docker Desktop summary. In summary, the image captures a student successfully building a Docker image for a Python-based application, highlighting their use of Docker for development and deployment, along with common data science and machine learning libraries.

The left pane displays the project's file structure, including files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. The `.env` file suggests environment variables are used. The `M` next to some files likely indicates their modification status. The right pane shows the contents of `app.py`, which appears to be a script defining project dependencies. These dependencies, listed within a commented-out array (`# dependencies = [...]`), include popular Python libraries like `requests`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dateutil`, `pandas`, `db-sqlite3`, `scipy`, `pybase64`, `python-dotenv`, `httpx`, `markdown`, and `duckdb`. The comments suggest this is a placeholder for dependency management, possibly using a package manager like `pip`. The code is well-commented. The overall structure suggests a data science or web application project.

Let's break down the elements: * **Explorer Pane (Left):** This displays the file structure of the student's local project directory. It shows a folder named \"Ilmagent\" containing several Python files (`.py`), a `Dockerfile`, a `LICENSE` file, and a `README.md` file. The presence of these files suggests a software project. The `.env` file likely contains environment variables. * **Editor Pane (Center):** The editor shows the contents of the `.env` file, which contains a single line defining an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` with a long, seemingly encoded value. This variable probably contains an API key or authentication token necessary for the Ilmagent project to work. * **Terminal Pane (Bottom):** This is the most important part for understanding the action. The student has executed the command `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/Ilmagent`. This command clones (downloads) a Git repository from GitHub into their local \"New folder (33)\". The subsequent output shows the progress of the cloning process, indicating successful completion: objects enumerated, counted, compressed, received, and deltas resolved. The numbers and speed show the size and speed of the download. In summary, the image depicts a student in the process of obtaining and setting up a pre-existing software project (\"Ilmagent\") from a GitHub repository. They've successfully cloned the repository and are likely ready to start working with the code. The `.env` file suggests the project requires an external API or service and the API key has already been obtained and stored in the .env file. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/5/a5f2b89e834352615300dcbbc2b2d74749da8e2e_2_690x378.png [Caption] This image shows a student working on a Python project using Docker. The left pane displays the project's file structure, including Python scripts (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `Dockerfile`, and other files. The `app.py` file lists various Python packages as dependencies (requests, fastapi, uvicorn, etc.), suggesting a web application or API. The central pane shows the code for `app.py`, a simple Python script with comments indicating it manages dependencies. The right pane shows a terminal window executing a `docker build` command. This command builds a Docker image from the `Dockerfile`, installing the specified Python packages within the image's environment. The output shows the various steps in the build process, including downloading base images, installing packages, and copying files. The successful completion (\"FINISHED\") indicates the Docker image was built successfully. Overall, the image illustrates a common workflow for software development involving: * **Python programming:** The student is writing a Python application. * **Dependency management:** The `app.py` file's dependencies and the `docker build` process show how the student manages external libraries. * **Containerization with Docker:** The student utilizes Docker to create a reproducible and portable environment for their application. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different systems. The image thus depicts a student engaged in a modern software development process, integrating multiple tools and technologies. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/f/5f6ef64ca044db4f86e841615328f2f0015d6df1_2_690x396.png [Caption] This image shows a student's screen during a programming assignment. The student is using a Python development environment (likely VS Code) and is working on a project involving data processing and potentially a web service. Here's a breakdown of what's visible: * **File Explorer:** Shows a project directory with files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, and others, suggesting a structured program with different components. * **Code Editor:** Shows some Python code, possibly configuration for an API (indicated by `AIPROXY_TOKEN`). * **Terminal:** This is the main area of interest. It displays the output of a command that attempts to run a Python script (`evaluate.py`) which interacts with a remote server (indicated by the long URL). The script appears to be performing several tasks: * Installing a dependency (`uv`). * Making POST and GET requests to a local server (localhost:8000) and a remote server. * Processing a date file (`datefile.txt`) to count Thursdays. * **Errors:** Several error messages are visible: * A 400 Bad Request error from a server interaction (likely due to a problem with the request's data, possibly a missing or incorrect argument). The error also points to an undefined `HTTPException`, suggesting a problem with the server-side code. * A \"WinError 2\" system error indicates the program can't find a specific file (`/data/datefile.txt`), suggesting a file path or file name issue. In short, the image captures a student encountering and debugging issues in a relatively complex programming assignment involving external API interactions, local server communication, and file processing. The student is likely working on integrating different parts of their code, fixing API calls, and resolving file path issues. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/4/440f4cd9014c4875f88e79b411d5dea05fcd83ec.png [Caption] This image shows a student using a code editor (likely VS Code) to clone a Git repository. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **File Explorer (Left):** The left pane displays the file structure of a project named \"Ilmagent.\" This project contains several Python files (`.py`), a `Dockerfile` (for containerization), a `LICENSE` file, and a `readme.md` file (likely containing project documentation). * **Code Editor Actions (Top Right):** The \"Start\" menu shows common actions in a code editor, such as creating new files, opening existing files or folders, and cloning a Git repository. \"Recent\" shows recently accessed projects. * **Terminal (Bottom):** The bottom section shows a terminal window where the student is using the `git clone` command to download a copy of the \"Ilmagent\" repository from GitHub. The progress of the cloning process is displayed, indicating the number of objects enumerated, counted, compressed, and received. The final line shows the successful completion of the cloning process. * **Overall:** The screenshot depicts a common workflow for a student working on a software development project. They're obtaining the source code from a remote repository (GitHub) to begin working on it locally. The presence of Python files, a `Dockerfile`, and standard project files suggests a structured software project. The use of Git and GitHub indicates the student is employing version control best practices.

It appears to be part of an automated system that verifies if a student has met the necessary requirements before submitting their work. Specifically: * **Github & Docker Repositories:** The student submitted their project code to a GitHub repository and a Docker repository, both identified by the ID \"23f2001390/lImagent\". The GitHub link is provided. * **Pre-requisites Check:** The system checks several things: * That both the Docker and GitHub repositories exist and are publicly accessible (meaning anyone can see the code). A timestamp check ensures they were created before February 18th. * That the GitHub repository contains either a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file (indicating an open-source license like MIT License is used). * That the GitHub repository contains a `Dockerfile` (the file which specifies how the Docker image should be built). * **Pass/Fail:** Each check results in a \"1\" (pass) or \"0\" (fail). In this case, all checks passed (all results are \"1\"). This suggests the student's project is ready for submission because it meets all the specified criteria. This automated system is likely used to streamline the submission process and ensure the projects meet a minimum standard of quality and openness.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/404", "type": "discourse_post"}

For a student, the key aspects are: * **File Structure:** The left-hand side lists the files in the repository. This shows a typical project structure, including configuration files (`.env`, `markdownlint.json`, `prettierrc.json`), a license file (`LICENSE`), a README file (`README.md`), source code files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasks8.py`), and a `Dockerfile` suggesting the project uses containerization. `requirements.txt` likely lists project dependencies. * **Commit History:** The right-hand side shows a summary of the repository's activity. It highlights that four commits were made approximately two months ago, all related to either adding files or an initial commit. This suggests a relatively small and recently created project. * **Project Status:** The repository has zero stars, zero forks, and only one person watching it. This indicates that the project is new and has not yet gained significant attention within the GitHub community. There are also no releases or packages published, indicating the project may be in early development stages. * **Version Control:** The display demonstrates the use of Git, a widely used version control system in software development, for managing the project's code and history. This is a fundamental skill for students learning software engineering. In short, the image depicts a small, recently created Python project (indicated by the `.py` files) hosted on GitHub, likely representing the work of a student or a very early-stage project. The image is useful for illustrating basic concepts of version control, project organization, and software development workflows. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/1/014b7a8714c79b6921eb8f8da545286cc6dbedc8.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named \"Delete evaluate.py\". The repository, created by user \"Sharmilecholan,\" contains several files, including configuration files (`.env`, `.markdownlint.json`, `.prettierrc.json`), a license file (`LICENSE`), a README file (`README.md`), Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`), a `requirements.txt` file (listing project dependencies), and a `Dockerfile` for containerization. The activity shows four commits made two months ago, all involving adding files via upload, except for two initial commits. The project has zero stars, one watcher, zero forks, and no releases or packages published. This suggests that it's a relatively new or inactive project. From a student perspective, this could be a project for a class, a personal project, or a part of a larger project. The files suggest that the project might involve data generation (`datagen.py`), some kind of application (`app.py`), and perhaps separate tasks (`tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`). The use of a `Dockerfile` indicates an effort to create a reproducible and portable development environment.

Here's a breakdown for a student: * **`Sharmiilecholan/tds_project1`:** This is the repository's name. \"Sharmiilecholan\" is likely the student's username or ID, and \"tds_project1\" suggests this is a project for a course, possibly titled \"TDS\" (which could stand for something like \"Technical Data Science\" or another course acronym). \"1\" might indicate it's the first project for the course. * **GitHub Logo (Octocat):** The small cat icon in the bottom right corner confirms that this is a GitHub repository. GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration on software projects. * **Metrics:** The numbers below show: * **Contributor: 1:** One person has contributed code to the repository (likely the student themselves). * **Issues: 0:** There are currently no reported problems or bugs. * **Stars: 0:** No one has \"starred\" the repository, indicating it's not yet widely known or considered particularly useful by the broader community. * **Forks: 0:** No one has created a copy of the repository to work on independently. In short, this is a screenshot showing a student's individual project hosted on GitHub, indicating a low level of external engagement, but suggesting the project is likely complete and without apparent issues.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/410", "type": "discourse_post"}

The report details the submission of both a GitHub repository and a Docker repository for a project titled \"TDS-Project-1-2025.\" The grading system checks several pre-requisites: * **Repository Existence and Public Access:** It verifies that both repositories exist and are publicly accessible before a specific deadline (February 18th). Both checks passed (indicated by \"1\"). * **License File:** The system confirms the presence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file in the GitHub repo, indicating the use of an MIT license. This check also passed. * **Dockerfile Existence:** The presence of a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository is also checked and passed. The report then presents a final score calculation: * **Task Score:** The student received a task score of 0. * **Bonus:** A bonus of 1 was awarded. * **P1 Score:** A P1 score of 1 was given. * **Final Score:** The final score is calculated as MIN(20, task score + bonus) = MIN(20, 0 + 1) = 1. Outliers don't affect the score. The report also notes that docker logs and an *evaluation log* have been provided. The evaluation log only exists if the student's API service worked within 5 minutes. The accompanying `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` files are included for the student's learning and debugging purposes. The table of A, B, and C values likely represents individual test cases or components of the overall project, all of which received a score of 0. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/3/c342418d20b935d414f96817c92300bcec289598_2_225x500.jpeg [Caption] This image shows the results of a student's submission for a project involving GitHub and Docker. The automated grading system checked several prerequisites: * **GitHub Repository:** The system verified that the student's GitHub repository existed, was public, and contained a LICENSE file (MIT license) and a timestamp before a specified date. All checks passed (indicated by '1'). * **Docker Repository:** Similarly, the system checked that the student's Docker repository existed, was public, and had a timestamp before the deadline. This also passed. * **Dockerfile:** The system confirmed the presence of a Dockerfile within the GitHub repository. The grading system then apparently analyzed the student's code (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5) resulting in a score of 0 for the task itself, but a bonus point was awarded for fulfilling the pre-requisites. The final P1 score is 1, reflecting the bonus point. The system also indicated that the student's API service did not start within the 5-minute time limit, hence only a docker log was available, as opposed to an evaluation log which would have provided more detailed information. The student is also informed that the `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` scripts used in the evaluation have been shared for learning purposes. In essence, the student received a minimal passing grade due to meeting prerequisites, but failed the main task. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/b/4bbeee344dad6a24766c6978889ccd69086dcc6d.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a log of a student's attempt at a programming task involving a database and a server. The task was to use a `datasette` server to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`), count the number of \"Bronze\" entries in a \"tickets\" table, save the result to a CSV file, and then stop the server. The log shows several steps: 1. **Task Definition:** The task is clearly outlined, specifying the database, table, query, output file location, and server shutdown. 2. **POST Request (B9):** A POST request was sent to the `datasette` server to initiate the task. This request contains a URL-encoded representation of the task details. The server returned a `500 Internal Server Error`. This indicates a problem within the server itself, preventing successful task execution. 3. **HTTP 500 Error:** The specific error message indicates a problem related to a filename, but the exact cause is not clear from the log alone. 4. **GET Request (B10):** After the POST request failed, a GET request was sent to try to read the supposedly created `/data/b10.csv` file. This resulted in a `404 Not Found` error, confirming that the file was not created due to the previous server error. 5. **B10 Failed:** This confirms that the attempt to read the output CSV failed because it didn't exist. 6. **Final Request:** A separate POST request to a different server (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`) successfully returned a `200 OK` status. This suggests the problem is isolated to the `datasette` server setup or configuration, and not a general networking issue. 7. **Score:** The student received a score of 9 out of 20, likely reflecting the failure of the core task to process the database query. In summary, the image documents a debugging process for a student's program. The student successfully sent requests to various servers, but encountered a server-side error (`500`) that prevented the completion of the primary database task. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/b/4bbeee344dad6a24766c6978889ccd69086dcc6d_2_225x500.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's debugging log from a programming assignment. The task was to use a Python library (likely Datasettte) to query a database (`ticket-sales.db`), count the number of \"Bronze\" tickets, save the result to a CSV file (`b10.csv`), and then stop the database server. The log shows several errors: * **B9 FAILED:** The initial attempt to run the Datasettte task failed with an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error). The error message indicates a problem with the filename. This suggests a file path issue, permission problem, or a problem with how the script interacts with the database server. * **B10 FAILED:** After the failed datasette run, the student attempted to read the supposedly created `b10.csv` file. This resulted in a 404 error (Not Found), confirming that the file wasn't created successfully due to the prior error. The successful `HTTP Request: POST` at the bottom suggests a separate, unrelated task completed successfully. This is likely part of a different section of the assignment that doesn't directly relate to the database query part. In short, the student's code failed to correctly execute the database query and save the results, resulting in a failed assignment (9/20 score). The log provides valuable debugging information pinpointing the errors at the database interaction stage, specifically the HTTP 500 error, indicating a server-side problem.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/412", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_616666_0", "content": "Dear @carlton This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the /app/app/main.py file is missing. However, in my project directory, the main.py file is located in the app/ folder, and the run.py file is in the root folder of the project, which is LLM_Automation_Agent . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py . To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py . I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder ( llm-automation-agent ). For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

The repository is named \"llm-automation-agent\" and belongs to user \"ksenthurkumaran1805200\". The repository has one contributor, zero open issues, zero stars, and zero forks. The small teal square icon is likely a custom logo or avatar for the repository. In a student context, this could be a student's project showcasing an agent built for automating tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). The lack of stars and forks suggests it's a relatively new or less popular project.

The project, \"LLM Automation Agent,\" is hosted on GitHub. The main window displays a Python script (`main.py` and `run.py`) that appears to interact with a web server (local host:8000) using a Flask framework. The code includes error handling and functionality for executing tasks (like counting Wednesdays in a data file). The terminal shows the Flask server running and successful API calls using `curl`. The student has executed the `run.py` file and made several POST requests to `/run`. The response indicates the task (\"count wednesdays\") was completed successfully. The GitHub window shows the project's repository with a commit history, indicating recent file additions and the removal of a sensitive GitHub token. In short, the image captures a student actively developing and testing a Python application, utilizing a web framework and integrating with a version control system. The student is clearly at a stage where they're testing the API endpoints of their application.

The student first lists Docker images, finding one with the ID `22f3002902`. Then, the student attempts to run this Docker image, but receives an error: `python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`. This error means the Python script `main.py`, which is expected to be inside the `/app/app` directory within the Docker container, is missing or not located in the expected path. This indicates a problem either with the Docker image's contents or with how the student is trying to run the image (perhaps the working directory within the container isn't set correctly). The `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN` part of the command suggests the student might be using some sort of proxy or authentication token. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c1d290bffaf6788ece5d9408b1c52566200a8cc9.png [Caption] This image shows a student's terminal session, likely during a computer science or software engineering course. The student is working with Docker, a containerization technology. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **`docker images | grep \"22f3002902\"`:** This command searches for a Docker image with a specific ID (22f3002902). The output shows that this image exists, is tagged as \"latest,\" has the longer ID `c739ff8a3247`, is 1.13GB in size and was built 6 days prior. This suggests the student might be working with a pre-built application or component. * **`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 c739ff8a3247`:** This is the crucial command. It runs the Docker image identified earlier. `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN` sets an environment variable, likely containing an authentication token, needed for the application within the container. `-p 8000:8000` maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container, which is often used for web applications or other network services. `c739ff8a3247` is the longer image ID. * **`python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`:** This is the error message. It indicates that the Python code within the Docker container cannot find the `main.py` file located in the `/app/app/` directory. This is a common error during software development, suggesting that the file might be missing, incorrectly named, or is in a different location than expected. The error likely means the student needs to check their application's file structure inside the container or within the image's build process. In summary, the image illustrates a common debugging scenario for a student working with Docker and Python. The student successfully located and tried to run a Docker image but encountered a file not found error, indicating a problem with their application's deployment or the Docker image's contents. The `AIPROXY_TOKEN` suggests the application likely interacts with an external service requiring authentication.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/423", "type": "discourse_post"}

It's relevant to students learning about API design and development. Here's a breakdown for a student audience: * **FastAPI:** This indicates the framework used to build the API. FastAPI is known for its speed and ease of use, often used in Python. The versions (0.1.0 and OAS 3.1) show the specific versions of the framework and the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) used to define the API. The OAS is a standard way to describe APIs in a machine-readable format. * **`default`:** This is likely the name of the API's main route or section. APIs often have multiple sections, but this suggests this is the primary one. * **GET, POST:** These are HTTP methods. `GET` requests retrieve data, while `POST` requests send data to the server to create or update something. The image shows three endpoints: * `/ask`: A GET request to the `/ask` endpoint, probably designed to fetch data. * `/run`: A POST request to the `/run` endpoint. This suggests sending data to trigger some action, potentially running a task. * `/read`: A GET request to the `/read` endpoint, likely designed for retrieving data, such as reading a file. * **`/ask`, `/run`, `/read`:** These are the paths (or endpoints) of the API. They specify the URL where requests are made. For example, a `GET` request might be sent to `http://127.0.0.1:0000/docs/ask`. (Note the address shown at the top.) * **`Ask`, `Run Task`, `Read File`:** These are descriptions of what each endpoint does. * **Schemas:** This section displays the data structures (schemas) used by the API. `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError` are common error types returned by APIs when something goes wrong with request validation. `object` indicates a generic JSON object structure (a dictionary in Python), but the details would be expanded upon if clicked. In summary, this image is a snapshot of interactive API documentation. It’s a valuable tool for developers to understand how to interact with an API—what requests to make, what data to send, and what responses to expect. Students working with APIs will encounter similar documentation frequently.

The repository, named `hilalazeez/llm-automation-agent`, contains a single image tagged as \"latest\". The image is of type \"Image\" and runs on an OS represented by the Linux penguin icon (implying Linux). The repository's size is 418.1 MB. The image has been analyzed by Docker Scout, revealing vulnerability details: 0 critical, 1 high, 4 medium, and 22 low vulnerabilities. The image was pulled 1 day ago and pushed about 2 months ago. The screenshot also displays the Docker command to push a new tag to the repository. Finally, it highlights information about Docker Build Cloud, a service offered to accelerate image builds. This suggests the student is using Docker for software development and is familiar with containerization and image management practices. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/9/c/9cd9e40f5ec0afeee28e1dcc5ad0340d2e5872d2_2_690x308.png [Caption] This image shows a student's Docker Hub repository. The repository, named `hilalazeez/llm-automation-agent`, contains a single image tagged \"latest\". The image is 418.1 MB in size and was last updated approximately two months ago. The repository's vulnerability scan shows no critical vulnerabilities, one high severity, four medium, twenty-two low, and no unknown vulnerabilities. The image has been pulled within the last day. The interface includes options to add a description and category to the repository, manage image tags, and collaborate with others. There's also a section promoting Docker Build Cloud, highlighting its benefits for faster and more efficient image building. The student has the option to make the repository public. The command to push a new tag to the repository is displayed. Overall, it illustrates a typical view of a Docker Hub repository for a project, likely related to a Large Language Model (LLM) automation agent.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. The page displays the API's endpoints under the \"default\" section. Specifically: * **Endpoints:** The API has three endpoints: * `/ask` (GET request): Likely used to ask a question or retrieve information. * `/run` (POST request): Likely used to initiate a task or process. The use of POST suggests that data is being sent to the server. * `/read` (GET request): Likely used to read a file or retrieve data. * **Schemas:** The \"Schemas\" section shows the data structures used for error handling. `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError` are likely custom error types defined by the API to provide more detailed error information to the client. The \"object\" type suggests these errors contain multiple attributes. * **Versioning:** The top right corner indicates that the API is version 0.1.0 and uses OpenAPI 3.1 specification. OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a standard for describing REST APIs. In a student context, this would be useful in a class on: * **Web Development:** Illustrating how APIs are structured and documented. * **Software Engineering:** Showing best practices for API design and error handling. * **Networking:** Demonstrating different HTTP methods (GET, POST). * **Data Structures:** Highlighting the use of JSON-like objects for data exchange. The image provides a clear example of a well-documented API, suitable for demonstrating core concepts in various computer science disciplines.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/428", "type": "discourse_post"}

As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent .

The assignment has four main parts: 1. **Dockerfile Creation:** Students must create a `Dockerfile` to build their application into a Docker image. 2. **Docker Hub Publication:** The built Docker image needs to be published publicly to Docker Hub, a repository for Docker images. 3. **Containerized API Deployment:** Students must demonstrate that running their Docker image using the `podman run` command (with provided parameters including an API proxy token and port mapping) correctly serves an API accessible via two specified URLs (one for running tasks, the other for reading data). The command shows how to use environment variables and port forwarding in Docker. 4. **Submission:** Finally, students must submit the URLs of their GitHub repository containing their code and their Docker Hub image name via a Google Form. This allows the instructor to assess both the code and the deployed containerized application. In essence, this is a practical assignment designed to teach students how to build, deploy, and share applications using Docker and containerization best practices. The use of `podman` suggests a focus on container runtime management as well.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/431", "type": "discourse_post"}

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

The script takes an email address and a root directory as input. It then creates the specified root directory if it doesn't exist and prints a disclaimer stating that the script is a work in progress. The main body of the script appears to consist of a series of function calls (e.g., `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, etc.) which are likely responsible for processing or generating data related to various tasks (formatting markdown, handling dates, contacts, logs, etc.). The functions' names suggest that the script is involved in organizing or processing data for a project. The comments indicate that the script's functionality will likely change before a final evaluation. Students should note the use of `os.path.abspath` to ensure the root directory path is absolute, and `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` to handle cases where the directory already exists. The script is designed to be run from the command line, allowing the user to specify the email and data root directory.

It displays error messages from a program that's trying to use fonts to create images (likely for a credit card image generation task). The core problem is an `OSError: cannot open resource`. This means the program cannot find or access the font files it needs (\"arial.ttf\" and \"DejaVuSans.ttf\"). The traceback shows the exact lines of code in the `ImageFont.truetype` function (part of the Pillow library, a popular image processing library in Python) where the errors occurred. It indicates the program attempts to load fonts, first from one location and then another, but both attempts fail. The multiple tracebacks suggest the error occurred in two different parts of the code, both attempting to load fonts for a function called `a8_credit_card_image()`. The paths shown point to a temporary file and a system font directory, respectively, making it probable that the temporary file (created by `datagen66arSL.py`) was not created correctly or contained the incorrect font data. For a student, this demonstrates: * **Error Handling:** How Python reports errors with detailed tracebacks. * **File Paths:** The importance of correct file paths in accessing resources. * **Library Usage:** How libraries (Pillow's `ImageFont`) can simplify tasks but still require correct configuration. * **Debugging:** The need to trace errors back to their root cause. The student could learn to investigate the creation of the temporary file and ensure correct font installation on their system to resolve the error.

Dockerfiles are used to automate the creation of Docker containers. Specifically, this section describes setting up the application environment within the container: * **`WORKDIR /app`**: This line sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. All subsequent commands will be executed within this directory. * **`COPY *.py /app/`**: This copies all Python files (`.py` extension) from the build context (your local machine) into the `/app` directory within the container. * **`COPY .env /app/`**: This copies a file named `.env` (likely containing environment variables) from the build context to the `/app` directory within the container. This is crucial for configuring the application within the containerized environment with things like API keys, database URLs, etc., without hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code. In short, these instructions prepare the application's runtime environment within the Docker container by setting the working directory and copying the necessary application code and configuration files. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for running the application, regardless of the host system.

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. This particular section describes setting up the application directory and copying files into it. * **`WORKDIR /app`**: This line sets the working directory inside the Docker container to `/app`. All subsequent commands will run within this directory. * **`COPY *.py /app/`**: This line copies all files ending in `.py` (presumably Python source code) from the current directory on the builder's machine into the `/app` directory within the container. * **`COPY .env /app/`**: This line copies a file named `.env` (likely containing environment variables) from the builder's current directory into the `/app` directory of the container. The `.env` file is crucial because it often holds sensitive information like API keys and database credentials that should not be hardcoded directly into the application. Storing it separately helps with security and maintainability. In summary, these lines ensure the application's code and environment variables are correctly placed within the Docker container during the build process. Students learning about Docker and containerization will find this example helpful in understanding how to structure their applications for deployment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/433", "type": "discourse_post"}

It's a student project, likely in a computer science or data science context, given the file names. Here's a breakdown for a student audience: * **Repository Structure:** The left side shows the files and folders within the repository. Key files include `app.py` (likely the main application code), `datagen.py` (possibly data generation code), `evaluate.py` (likely for model evaluation), and `Ilm_code.py` (potentially code related to large language models). The presence of a `Dockerfile` suggests the project might be designed to run in a containerized environment. The `data` folder indicates that the project uses data, and the `LICENSE` file shows it's using an MIT license (a permissive open-source license). * **Version Control:** The repository uses Git for version control, as indicated by the branches (\"master\" and another branch 8 commits ahead), commits, and the ability to add files and contribute. The \"2 months ago\" timestamps on the commits suggest recent activity. * **Collaboration:** The project might be a collaborative effort, as more than one branch exists. The \"Contribute\" button implies that others can contribute to the project. * **Lack of Description:** The \"About\" section shows the project lacks a description, website, or topics. This is common for student projects in early stages of development. * **Deployment:** The absence of releases and packages indicates the project is not yet ready for deployment or distribution to a wider audience. In short, this screenshot shows a student's relatively small, recently active Python project hosted on GitHub, that may use machine learning related code. The project is likely under development and hasn't yet been packaged or released. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/0/40c10210a7c33774133ec99e68ad77a840209387.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project called \"project1_final\". The repository is public and currently has: * **Two branches:** `master` and another branch named after the user `swati-iitm`. The `master` branch is 8 commits behind the current branch. * **Nine commits:** The most recent commit was made two months ago. * **Several files:** These include code files (`.py`), a `Dockerfile` (for containerization), a `LICENSE` file, and a `data` folder. * **No releases or packages:** The project hasn't yet published any releases or packages. * **Zero stars, forks, and watchers:** This indicates the project is new or not very well-known yet. The main branch (`master`) is listed as being behind the current active branch, which is likely where the student is currently working. The presence of files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, and `evaluate.py` suggest that this is a software project, potentially involving data generation, model evaluation, and possibly a machine learning or similar application given the filename `Ilm_code.py`. The use of a `Dockerfile` implies an attempt to standardize the project's environment for reproducibility.

The final score is calculated as the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and any bonus points. The student submitted their work to both Github and Docker repositories. The grading includes a pre-requisites check, ensuring that the student's submissions met certain criteria (e.g., the repositories existed, were public, and included a license and Dockerfile). Each of these criteria receives a score of either 1 (pass) or 0 (fail). The image shows a table listing numerous checks (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5), where 1 indicates success and 0 indicates failure for each specific check. The student's total task score is 3, their bonus is 0, leading to a final project score (P1 score) of 4.

The commit, made on March 30th, 2025, by a user named rsjay1976, is titled \"Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies\". The message indicates that the user updated a Dockerfile to remove hardcoded proxy settings. The \"Verified\" label suggests the commit has been reviewed and approved. The hash `a71e3a8` is the unique identifier for this commit. In a student context, this could represent a student's contribution to a group project, showcasing their ability to improve code quality and security by removing hardcoded values. The use of Docker suggests they are working on a software project that utilizes containerization.

The student is using a platform called \"labs.play-with-docker.com\" to access a virtual machine (VM) with the ID `cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg`. The VM has an IP address of `192.168.0.13`. The student is currently using the SSH protocol (`ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlfo01209000cd7icg0@direct.labs.play-`) to connect to the VM. At the bottom of the screen, the student is using the `docker build` command to build a Docker image named `tdsproject1` and tagged as `latest`. The output of the command is redirected to a file named `tds-projlbuild.log`. The interface provides options to manage the VM, including closing the session, accessing settings, deleting the VM, and opening a port. The top of the screenshot shows the current time, indicating the lab session is ongoing. The browser history bar suggests the student may be multitasking.

The message, \"Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies,\" indicates a change was made to a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document used to automate the creation of Docker containers. The change specifically involved removing hard-coded proxy settings. The commit was made on March 30th, 2025, by user rsjay1976, and has been verified. The `a71e3a8` is likely a commit hash. In a student context, this would be relevant to courses covering software development, DevOps, or containerization technologies. The removal of hard-coded proxies improves security and maintainability of the Docker image by preventing unexpected behavior depending on the environment.

The interface displays information about a specific instance identified by a long alphanumeric code (`cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol2o9000cd7icg`). Key elements visible include: * **Server Details:** The IP address (192.168.0.13), SSH connection string, and options to open ports, delete the instance, and access a file editor are shown. The server's memory and CPU usage are also displayed (though values are not visible). * **Docker Build Command:** The terminal window at the bottom shows a Docker command being executed (`docker build -t tdsproject1:latest > tds-projlbuild.log`). This suggests the student is building a Docker image named `tdsproject1` and redirecting the output to a log file. * **Session Timer:** A timer (:44:22) indicates the duration of the current session. * **Control Panel:** The top-left shows options to manage the server instance (settings and a wrench icon), and a \"Close Session\" button. In essence, the image depicts a student working on a project that involves using Docker to build and manage a containerized application on a remote server within a virtualized lab setup.

The student is attempting to build a Docker image for a project (TDS-Project1). The build process involves several steps, including downloading a Python base image and installing dependencies using `apt-get`. The crucial error is highlighted: the command `RUN uv --version` failed with exit code 127, indicating that the `uv` command is not found. This means the `uv` (likely libuv, a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library) was not successfully installed earlier in the Dockerfile, even though there's an attempt to install it using `curl -sSfL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. The error message \"0.240/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found\" further confirms the `uv` executable is missing from the container's environment. The student needs to troubleshoot why the `uv` installation failed. Possible reasons include issues with the installation script, network connectivity problems during the `curl` command, or missing dependencies required for `uv` to compile or install correctly. The student will need to investigate these possibilities to resolve the build error and successfully create the Docker image.

The student is attempting to build a Docker image (tagged `22f3002723:latest`) for a project. The build process involves several steps, including downloading dependencies (like Python) and installing a package (`uv`). The build fails at the `RUN uv --version` command, which indicates the `uv` package is not found. The error message clearly states this: `0.240/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found`. This suggests that despite earlier steps installing `uv` (via `curl -sSfL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`), the installation was unsuccessful, or the package wasn't installed correctly within the Docker image's environment. The Dockerfile (shown partially) highlights the problematic line (line 25) where the `uv` version check is performed. This error needs to be investigated and resolved by the student. They will likely need to review the `uv` installation command in the Dockerfile and troubleshoot why it failed to install the package properly within the container. Possible solutions might include checking the installation script, network connectivity within the container, or ensuring correct dependencies for `uv` are available.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/443", "type": "discourse_post"}

The repository contains various files, including a `dockerfile`, Python scripts (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`), and standard project files like `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`. The repository's activity shows several commits over the past two months, primarily focused on Dockerfile updates and initial commits. The repository is publicly accessible, has zero stars and forks, and lacks a description. The image illustrates a student's use of version control (Git) and containerization (Docker) during software development. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/e/a/eaea99d88c244f6d9e7407183e4d96e2e1c35d2f.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named \"task_agent_api\". The repository is publicly accessible and contains several files, including a `Dockerfile`, Python scripts (`.py`), a `requirements.txt` file (listing project dependencies), and other files related to project setup and configuration (like `.env` and a `LICENSE`). The file list indicates that the project involves Docker for deployment and that the code is likely written in Python. The commit history shows four commits made within the last two months, suggesting recent activity and development. The project currently lacks a description, and there are no published releases or packages. This suggests it is likely a work in progress or a relatively new project. In a student context, this could represent a student's project for a software development course, possibly involving containerization (using Docker) and Python programming. The lack of a description and releases could indicate that the project is still under development or that the student hasn't yet completed the final stages of documentation and deployment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/447", "type": "discourse_post"}

This means that the specific page or resource requested by the user ( `/r/maheshsingh01/tdsrepos/tags` in this case) was not found on the server. In a student context, this could be due to several reasons: * **Incorrect URL:** The student may have typed the URL incorrectly or there may be a typo in the link they clicked. * **Resource Removed:** The Docker image or repository might have been deleted or renamed by the owner. * **Server-Side Issue:** There could be a temporary problem with the Docker Hub server, making the requested page inaccessible. The 404 error is a common occurrence online and indicates that the student needs to double-check the URL or contact the repository owner if they believe the resource should exist.

Note that it uses a common academic email format. * **GitHub Repository Link:** A link to the student's GitHub repository containing the code for Project 1. The repository names suggest different versions or related projects (`tds_proj` and `tdsrepos`). * **DockerHub Image Name:** The name of the Docker image published by the student. The search bar at the top indicates a student ID, `23f1001236`, was used to find these specific entries. This implies the system allows searching and tracking individual student submissions. The data suggests the student made multiple submissions to the project.

A student in a software development course would recognize this as a list of files added to a repository two months ago by a user named \"wag28\" (likely a username or identifier). Key elements for a student to understand: * **Files:** The list shows various file types common in software projects, including: * `.dockerignore`: A file that tells Docker which files or directories to ignore when building a Docker image. * `.gitattributes`: A file that specifies how Git should handle line endings and other attributes of files in the repository. * `.gitignore`: A file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing changes. * `LICENSE`: Contains the license information for the project. * `README.md`: A Markdown file providing information about the project. * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`: Likely Python files containing the application's code, data generation logic, evaluation functions, and separate tasks (A and B). * `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies (external libraries). * `Dockerfile`: A file that describes how to build a Docker image. * **Commits:** Each entry represents a commit – a snapshot of the project's state at a specific point in time. All the files listed were \"added\" in this particular commit. \"Initial commit\" signifies the very first commit to the repository. * **Time:** All the changes were made two months prior to the screenshot. * **User:** \"wag28\" is the user who made these commits. \"eff178a\" likely represents a commit hash or similar identifier. In summary, the image illustrates a basic, yet complete, initial commit to a software project, showcasing the foundational files and structure typical of a new software repository. The image could be used as a teaching example of version control and project organization in a software engineering class. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/3/1312efae69b50e418bc708a80bd11f752a9be4a5.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a commit history from a version control system, likely Git. A student might see this in a software development or data science course. The key takeaways for a student are: * **Files Added:** The left column shows a list of files that were added to a project two months ago by user `wag28` (likely a username or identifier). These files include standard project components: * `.dockerignore`: Configures Docker to ignore certain files/folders. * `.gitattributes`: Defines Git attributes for handling different file types. * `.gitignore`: Specifies files/folders to exclude from version control. * `LICENSE`: The project's license file. * `README.md`: A description of the project. * `app.py` (and others): Python scripts (likely core application logic, data generation, and specific tasks). * `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies. * **Version Control:** The image illustrates the concept of version control, showing a specific commit (changes made to the project) with timestamps. It indicates the files that were added in this particular commit. * **Project Structure:** It gives a glimpse into the basic structure of a Python project, including the use of Docker for containerization (`.dockerignore` and `Dockerfile`). * **Teamwork (Implied):** While only one user is directly visible (`wag28`), the presence of multiple files and the timestamp suggests collaborative work. Other users might have contributed to different parts of the project. In short, this image provides a snapshot of a project's development history, highlighting file creation within a version control system, commonly used in student projects involving programming and software development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/467", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student's P1 submission failed an initial check because the `Dockerfile` was not in the root directory of their GitHub repository. The instructor is relaxing this requirement and will instead review submissions after the end of term. A script will search for the `Dockerfile` in the student's GitHub repository. Any changes to the repository after February 18th will not be considered, and spelling errors in the required files will also result in failure. All other project requirements remain in effect. The student's Docker image must build without errors and become operational within 5 minutes. Final evaluation will be based on the specified test environment. The email indicates there are 99+ unread emails and 4 unread messages in the associated communication platform.

Initially, the student's submission failed a prerequisite because the `Dockerfile` wasn't in the root directory of their GitHub repository. The instructor is now relaxing that requirement. However, there are important changes to the submission process: * **Late Submission:** The P1 submissions will be reviewed only *after* the end of term. * **Automated Search:** A script will search the entire GitHub repository for the `Dockerfile`. * **No Changes After Feb 18th:** Any changes to the GitHub repo after February 18th will not be considered. * **No Spelling Errors:** Spelling errors in the required files will result in failure. * **Docker Requirements:** The Docker image must build without errors and the container must become operational within 5 minutes of starting. * **Evaluation:** The final evaluation will be based on the specified test environment. In short, the email explains a change in the grading criteria for P1, provides instructions for resubmission, and reinforces the remaining requirements for successful completion. The key change is that the location of the `Dockerfile` is no longer strictly enforced, but the submission still needs to meet all other specifications.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/478", "type": "discourse_post"}

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue.

This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.

{"id": "discourse_617533_0", "content": "I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir.

{"id": "discourse_617591_0", "content": "Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.

{"id": "discourse_618186_0", "content": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/34", "type": "discourse_post"}

Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.

So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/40", "type": "discourse_post"}

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/43", "type": "discourse_post"}

Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college.

It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message.

This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.

{"id": "discourse_619094_0", "content": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.

This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.

The quiz question involves using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on the Earth's surface, given their latitude and longitude. The student is presented with a step-by-step guide: 1. **Convert degrees to radians:** The formula for this conversion is provided. 2. **Calculate differences in latitude and longitude:** This step involves finding the differences between the coordinates of the two points. 3. **Apply the Haversine formula:** The full formula, including the radius of the Earth, is shown. A simplified version is also given. The student has attempted the first step, converting the latitude and longitude of two locations (A and B) from degrees to radians. They have presented their calculated values, and the question asks if their conversion is correct. The interface suggests a learning environment, likely an online platform for practice quizzes or exams.

Students must select the sequence of communities that minimizes the total distance traveled, starting and ending at the central command post, always moving to the nearest community next. The provided code snippet suggests using the Haversine formula to calculate the shortest distances between these points. The correct answer will be the sequence that represents the shortest path calculated using the distances between all locations.

Given the coordinates of four communities (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, Red Point Town) and a central command post, the student must select the best evacuation sequence using the \"nearest community first\" strategy. This means the evacuation route should prioritize the shortest distance between communities at each step. The student needs to calculate distances using the provided coordinates (possibly using the `haversine` function shown in the snippet of Python code) and choose the sequence that minimizes the overall travel distance. The correct answer is the sequence that represents the shortest path connecting all communities before returning to the starting point ('Start/End'). [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/e/9e4fdb96e0a90caace70968fd4201106dc133169.png [Caption] This Python code snippet demonstrates how to determine the optimal evacuation route for several communities to a central command post. **1. Data Input:** The code begins by defining the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for four communities (OakParkTown, EastSpringsSettlement, EastFieldsJunction, RedPointTown) and a central command post (CentralCommandPostLocation). **2. Distance Calculation:** It then uses the `haversine` function (imported from the `haversine` library) to calculate the straight-line distance (in kilometers) between each community and the central command post. These distances are stored in a dictionary called `distances`. The `haversine` function likely accounts for the curvature of the Earth when calculating distances. **3. Sorting and Optimization:** The code sorts the communities based on their calculated distances to the central command post, using the `sorted()` function with a custom key (`key=distances.get`) to sort by the distance values. The result is stored in `optimal_sequence`, which now represents the order of communities closest to farthest from the command post. **4. Output:** Finally, the code iterates through the `optimal_sequence` and prints a numbered list showing each community and its distance to the central command post, formatted to two decimal places. This list presents the optimal evacuation sequence, starting with the closest community and proceeding to the farthest.

A correlation matrix shows the correlation coefficient between different variables. In this specific case, it analyzes the relationship between four variables related to vehicle characteristics and value: * **Engine Capacity (cc):** The size of the engine in cubic centimeters. * **Mileage (km/l):** Fuel efficiency measured in kilometers per liter. * **Average Daily Distance (km):** The average distance driven daily. * **Price Retention (%):** The percentage of the original price retained after a period of time. **Interpreting the Matrix:** Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation between two variables. The numbers range from -1 to +1: * **+1:** Perfect positive correlation. As one variable increases, the other increases proportionally. * **0:** No correlation. The variables are independent of each other. * **-1:** Perfect negative correlation. As one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally. The color scale helps visualize the strength of the correlation. Darker reds indicate strong positive correlation, while darker blues indicate strong negative correlation. Light colors represent weak correlations. **Example Interpretation:** The strong positive correlation (1.00) between \"Engine Capacity (cc)\" and itself is expected (as a variable is perfectly correlated with itself). The value of 1.00 for \"Price Retention (%)\" with itself is also expected. A more interesting observation is the relatively weak correlation between 'Engine Capacity' and 'Price Retention', where a larger engine size is only slightly associated with better price retention. Similarly, there is a small negative correlation between 'Average Daily Distance' and 'Price Retention', suggesting that higher daily mileage might be associated with lower price retention (though this correlation is weak). **Student Application:** This matrix would be useful in a statistics or data analysis class to illustrate correlation, visualization of data, and interpretation of results. Students could be asked to explain the relationships between the variables, identify significant correlations, and discuss potential limitations of the analysis (e.g., correlation does not imply causation; other factors might influence price retention). [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/b/4/b468c32e53fddf462c583b8664f183dd7afe37aa_2_690x277.png [Caption] This is a multiple-choice question from a quiz or online assignment. The student is acting as a strategic consultant for a motorcycle dealership and needs to determine which factor most influences the resale value of Royal Enfield motorcycles in Uttar Pradesh, India. They are given data showing Pearson correlation coefficients for mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity. The student needs to select the correlation coefficient that best indicates the strongest relationship between a factor and resale price. The student incorrectly answered with 'EngineCapacity: 0.09' initially, but the correct answer is revealed as 'EngineCapacity: 0.09'. The question tests understanding of correlation, data analysis, and the application of statistical concepts in a business context. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/5/c524c9f7645716e0fac9d8850df15c4c20af05dc_2_690x397.png [Caption] This heatmap shows the correlation between different variables related to a car's attributes and its price retention. The variables are: * **Engine Capacity (cc):** The size of the car's engine. * **Mileage (km/l):** The fuel efficiency of the car (kilometers per liter). * **Avg Daily Distance (km):** The average distance driven daily. * **Price Retention (%):** The percentage of the original price retained after a period of time. The numbers in each cell represent the correlation coefficient. A value of 1.00 indicates a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases), -1.00 indicates a perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases), and 0 indicates no linear correlation. The color scale shows the strength of the correlation, with darker reds indicating strong positive correlations and darker blues indicating strong negative correlations. **For example:** * The strong positive correlation (1.00) between \"Engine Capacity (cc)\" and itself is expected. * The strong positive correlation between \"Price Retention (%)\" and itself is also expected. * A correlation close to 0 between \"Mileage (km/l)\" and \"Price Retention (%)\" suggests that fuel efficiency doesn't significantly influence price retention. Similarly, the weak negative correlation between \"Average Daily Distance (km)\" and \"Price Retention (%)\" suggests that higher daily mileage may slightly negatively affect resale value. * The moderately positive correlation between \"Engine Capacity (cc)\" and \"Price Retention (%)\" might suggest that larger engines are associated with better price retention, but further analysis is needed to confirm this. In a student context, this visualization could be used to illustrate concepts like: * **Correlation vs. Causation:** It's crucial to understand that correlation does not equal causation. While the heatmap shows relationships between variables, it doesn't prove that one variable *causes* changes in another. * **Data Analysis & Interpretation:** Students can practice interpreting the heatmap to understand relationships between variables and formulate hypotheses for further investigation. * **Statistical Analysis:** The heatmap is a visual representation of correlation coefficients, a fundamental concept in statistical analysis. This would be useful in a statistics, data analysis, or even economics class focusing on applied research.

The question asks the student to determine which factor, among mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity, has the strongest correlation with the price retention of Royal Enfield motorcycles in Uttar Pradesh, India. The student is instructed to use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and is given four options, each representing a factor and its correlation coefficient. The student initially selected an incorrect answer ('EngineCapacity: 0.95') resulting in a score of 0. The correct answer, revealed at the bottom, is 'EngineCapacity: 0.09'. This indicates that engine capacity has a weak positive correlation with the resale value of the motorcycles in this specific context. The relatively low correlation coefficient suggests that engine capacity is not a major driver of resale price in this market.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283/36", "type": "discourse_post"}

The question asks which of the given code snippets is the best way to determine if a timestamp represents a Saturday. The timestamp is assumed to be an object from Python's `datetime` library. The options present different ways to check the day of the week: * **Option 1:** Checks if the weekday number is 5 (often Monday is 0, so 5 would be Saturday). Incorrect, as weekday numbering varies. * **Option 2:** Checks if the weekday number is 6 (Saturday). This is the correct answer because `weekday()` typically returns 6 for Saturday. * **Option 3:** Uses `strftime('%A')` to get the full name of the day and compares it to \"Saturday\". While correct, it's less efficient than checking the numerical weekday. * **Option 4:** Uses `dayname()` to get the day name and compares it to \"Saturday\". Similar to Option 3, functional but less efficient than option 2. The question tests the student's understanding of the `datetime` library in Python, specifically the most efficient and reliable way to check for a specific day of the week. The correct answer is option 2 because it directly checks the numerical representation of the weekday, avoiding string comparisons. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/1/1147fa7bca00db3d2085d116f674364128961293.jpeg [Caption] This is a multiple choice question (MCQ) from a computer programming exam. The question asks what is the best method to determine if a timestamp represents a Saturday, given that `timestamp` is a datetime object. The student is presented with four options, each suggesting a different approach using Python's `datetime` library: * **Option 1 (Incorrect):** `timestamp.weekday() == 5`. This checks if the day of the week is 5 (where Monday is 0, Sunday is 6). This is incorrect because Saturday is represented by 5, not 6. * **Option 2 (Correct):** `timestamp.weekday() == 6`. This correctly identifies Saturday as the 6th day of the week. * **Option 3 (Incorrect):** `timestamp.strftime('%A') == 'Saturday'`. While functional, this is less efficient than `weekday()` as it involves formatting the entire date string. * **Option 4 (Incorrect):** `timestamp.dayname() == 'Saturday'`. This is similar to Option 3; it's a valid but less efficient way to check for Saturday. The correct answer is Option 2 because it's the most direct and efficient way to check the day of the week within the `datetime` library.

The excavator's bucket is partially extended, suggesting an attempt to either interact with or deter the elephant. This image could be used to illustrate several points in a classroom setting, including: * **Human-wildlife conflict:** The image clearly shows a direct confrontation between humans (represented by the machinery) and a wild animal. It can spark discussions about habitat encroachment, land use issues, and the challenges of balancing human needs with wildlife conservation. * **The power of nature:** The elephant's size and aggressive posture highlight the immense power of nature and the potential dangers of disturbing wild animals, especially large ones like elephants. * **Environmental impact:** The dust cloud illustrates the environmental impact of human activity, even on a small scale. * **Ethical considerations:** The image provokes questions about ethical treatment of animals and responsible land management practices. Is the use of machinery in this scenario justified? What are the potential consequences of such actions?

Students working on open-source projects or collaborative coding assignments will find this useful. The steps are numbered and clearly explained, walking through: 1. **Naming the license file:** The user should create a file named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`. 2. **Choosing a license template:** GitHub provides a selection of standard open-source licenses. The screenshot highlights where to choose one. 3. **Reviewing and selecting a license:** The instructions explain how to browse the available options on the left sidebar and choose the appropriate one for their project. 4. **Submitting the changes:** The final step involves reviewing the selection and submitting it to finalize the addition of the license to the repository. The images of the GitHub interface show the practical implementation of these steps, making the instructions easy to follow for a student.

The history is organized by date, showing four distinct commits made by a user named `virajpitale`: * **April 3, 2025:** The user renamed a file from `License.md` to `LICENSE.md`. This is likely a simple capitalization correction or a standard practice for file naming conventions. * **February 17, 2025:** The user updated the `License.md` file. This suggests a change in the project's license details. * **February 15, 2025:** The user made two commits on the same day: * First, they updated and renamed a file from `README.md` to `License.md`. This likely involved combining documentation about the project's license into a single file. * Second, a commit titled \"project\" suggests a more general change or addition to the project itself. Each commit includes a unique identifier (e.g., `d62d2ee`, `762400b`), a verification status, and potentially other metadata. The `Verified` label indicates the commit was verified or checked. The image illustrates a well-maintained and organized version control workflow, important for collaborative projects.

Each section represents a commit, showing: * **Date:** The date and time the commit was made. Notice that there are commits from April 3rd, February 17th, and February 15th, 2025. * **Commit Message:** A brief description of the changes made in that commit. Examples include renaming files (e.g., \"Rename License.md to LICENSE.md\"), updating files (e.g., \"Update License.md\"), and a more general commit titled \"project\". * **Author:** The username (\"virajpitale\") who made the commit. * **Commit Hash (SHA):** A unique identifier (a hexadecimal string like \"d62d2ee\" or \"7624006\") for each commit. This allows for easy referencing of specific versions of the code. * **Verified Status:** A green \"Verified\" label suggests a process (possibly automated testing) has confirmed the commit's correctness. * **File Changes:** There is a small file icon and a count of how many files changed. In a student context, this image demonstrates: * **Version Control:** A crucial skill for collaborative software development. Students learn to use version control (like Git) to track changes, manage different versions of their code, and collaborate effectively on projects. * **Commit Messages:** The importance of clear and concise commit messages. Good commit messages make it easy to understand the history and purpose of each change. * **File Management:** How file names and locations are handled in a project, highlighting the use of consistent naming conventions (like using uppercase for license files). * **Collaborative Work:** This shows a single author, but multiple authors and merge history might be demonstrated elsewhere in the same system, highlighting team development practices. Overall, the image provides a visual representation of a small project's development history within a version control system, useful for teaching concepts related to software development and collaboration.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-failed/171672/5", "type": "discourse_post"}

It displays the project's file structure and commit history. **For a student, here's a breakdown of what's important:** * **File Structure:** The left side shows the files and folders within the project. Key files include: * `app.py`: Likely the main Python program file. * `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies (external libraries needed to run the code). * `Dockerfile`: Indicates the project uses Docker for containerization (packaging the application and its dependencies for easy deployment). * `LICENSE` and `MIT LICENSE`: Shows the project's open-source license (MIT License in this case), crucial for understanding how the code can be used and shared. * `_pycache_`: A folder containing compiled Python bytecode (a temporary folder, usually ignored in version control). * `venv`: A virtual environment, isolating the project's dependencies from other Python projects on the system. * `test.txt`: Likely a file containing test data or examples. * **Commit History:** The right side shows the project's commit history, including: * **Commit Messages:** Descriptive messages about the changes made in each commit (\"Final Submission\", \"First submission\", \"Create LICENSE\"). These messages are vital for understanding the evolution of the project. * **Commit Timestamps:** The date and time of each commit, showing when changes were made (\"2 months ago\", \"now\"). * **Commit Hash:** `c61a6ef` represents a unique identifier for the latest commit. **In a student context, this image could represent:** * **A completed programming assignment:** The student has uploaded their finished project to a repository, documenting its files, dependencies, and development history. * **A collaborative project:** Multiple commits and multiple students' contributions can be inferred from the history. * **A software engineering practice:** The use of version control (Git), virtual environments, Docker, and clear commit messages demonstrates best practices in software development. In short, the image illustrates a well-organized and documented software project, showcasing good practices students should aim for in their own work.

The repository is publicly accessible. The main branch is displayed, along with a list of files and folders. The file list includes: * **`_pycache_`**: A folder containing compiled Python files. This is automatically generated by Python and usually not directly modified. * **`venv`**: A virtual environment folder, used to isolate project dependencies. * **`Dockerfile`**: A file that describes how to build a Docker image for the project. This suggests the project may be designed to run in a container. * **`LICENSE`** and **`MIT LICENSE`**: Files containing the project's license information. The history shows the license was initially created and then renamed to the MIT License. * **`app.py`**: Likely the main application file of the project (written in Python). * **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the project's dependencies. This is a standard way to manage Python project dependencies. * **`test.txt`**: Likely a test file, though the content isn't shown. The right-hand column shows the commit history for each file, indicating the actions performed and when they were done. \"First submission\" likely indicates initial commits and \"Final Submission\" denotes the final version submitted. The fact that the most recent actions were made \"now\" indicates the student is actively working on the project. The use of version control is a good indicator of organized and well-managed student work.

The check assesses whether the necessary components are in place before the project can proceed. Each line represents a check, with \"1\" indicating success and \"0\" indicating failure. The checks include: * **Docker repository:** Verifies the existence of a public Docker repository created before February 18th. This passed (1). * **GitHub repository:** Verifies the existence of a public GitHub repository created before February 18th. This passed (1). * **GitHub License:** Checks for a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (specifically an MIT License) in the GitHub repository. This failed (0). * **GitHub Dockerfile:** Checks for a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. This passed (1). In short, the pre-requisites check had one failure: the missing or incorrect license file in the GitHub repository. The student needs to address this before proceeding.

The submission was made via a GitHub repository (the link is provided). The reason for failure is twofold: 1. **The repository doesn't exist or is inaccessible:** The system couldn't find the specified repository on GitHub. 2. **Missing MIT License and Dockerfile:** The submission was missing a file stating that the project is licensed under the MIT license, and it also lacked a Dockerfile, which is essential for containerizing the application. The automatic grader checked for these files as part of its evaluation criteria. The student needs to fix these issues and resubmit. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/4/249405cda01477954f6512c23abf1e0847f2f922.png [Caption] This is a message from an automated grading system informing a student that their project submission failed. The submission, located at the provided GitHub link, failed because: 1. **The repository doesn't exist.** The grader couldn't find the project at the specified GitHub URL. 2. **The MIT license is missing.** The project needs an MIT license file (LICENSE) to be included. 3. **There's no Dockerfile.** The project requires a Dockerfile to build and run correctly. Essentially, the student's project is incomplete and needs the missing files before it can be graded successfully.

It lists the files changed and the actions taken, along with timestamps. Here's a breakdown relevant to a student: * **22f3000585:** Likely a project ID or similar identifier. * **Files:** The list shows common project files: * `_pycache_`: A directory containing compiled Python bytecode (likely automatically generated). * `venv`: A virtual environment, isolating the project's dependencies. * `Dockerfile`: A file for creating a Docker container (indicates a more advanced project). * `LICENSE`: A license file (initially created and then changed). * `MIT LICENSE`: The final license chosen (likely MIT License). * `app.py`: The main application file (Python code). * `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies for easy reproducibility. * `test.txt`: Likely a test file, though the contents are unknown. * **Commit Messages:** Describe the changes made in each commit. They range from initial submissions to final submissions, and also include a license change. * **Timestamps:** Show when each commit was made, indicating the project's development timeline. The final submission and many other files were submitted 2 months ago. The LICENSE was created (and later renamed) 5 days ago, showing a recent change. * **Commit Count:** Shows a total of 6 commits to the project. In short, this image provides a concise history of a student's programming project, highlighting the stages of development and the files involved. It's a valuable tool for tracking progress and understanding the project's evolution.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-discrepancy-regarding-mit-license/171485/10", "type": "discourse_post"}

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

The API should be accessible via `http://localhost:8000/run` and `http://localhost:8000/read`. 7. **Submit URLs:** Submit the URLs of their GitHub repository and Docker Hub image via a provided Google Form. **Notes:** The notes provide crucial instructions and limitations: 1. **AI Proxy Token:** Students must use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable; **do not** commit it to their repository. 2. **Token Limit:** The AI Proxy token has a $1 limit, encouraging efficient use. 3. **GPT-40-Mini:** Only GPT-40-Mini is supported as the language model. 4. **Prompt Length:** Prompts should be short (to stay within the 20-second time limit for each API call). In essence, this is a programming assignment focusing on API creation, Dockerization, and version control, all while adhering to specified constraints and using an external AI service. The evaluation section (indicated but not detailed) presumably assesses the successful completion of these deliverables.

The code needs to handle creation of necessary files. 3. **Dockerize the application:** Create a Dockerfile to build the application into a Docker image. 4. **Deploy to Docker Hub:** Publish the Docker image publicly on Docker Hub. 5. **Run with AI Proxy:** Use `podman` to run the Docker image, passing the AI Proxy token as an environment variable to automatically serve the API on ports 8000. 6. **Submit URLs:** Submit the URLs of their GitHub repository and Docker image to a Google Form. **Constraints:** * **Security:** The AI Proxy token should *not* be committed to the GitHub repository. It must be set as an environment variable before running the application. * **Token Limit:** The AI Proxy token has a $1 limit. Students are encouraged to use it sparingly and contact the teaching staff for more tokens if needed. * **Model Restriction:** Only the GPT-40-Mini model is supported by the AI Proxy. * **Performance:** Each API call (to `/run` and `/read`) must complete within 20 seconds. Prompts must be concise and short. In short, the assignment involves full-stack development (code, Docker, GitHub), emphasizing secure handling of API keys and efficient use of resources (both in terms of API calls and token usage).

Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file) Once done you can commit it.

To be eligible for evaluation, the student's work must meet several criteria: 1. **GitHub Repository:** A publicly accessible GitHub repository must exist containing the project. 2. **Licensing:** The repository must include a `LICENSE` file using the MIT license. This ensures the code is properly licensed and can be used by others. 3. **Dockerfile:** A valid `Dockerfile` needs to be present in the repository. This allows for consistent and reproducible deployment of the project using Docker. 4. **Docker Image:** A publicly accessible Docker image built from the provided `Dockerfile` must run successfully using the given `podman` command. The command shows how to run the image, specifying environment variables and port mapping (exposing port 8000 on the host). 5. **Consistency:** The Docker image must be built using the same `Dockerfile` present in the GitHub repository. This ensures integrity and reproducibility. In short, this outlines the technical requirements and submission guidelines for a student project, emphasizing the use of version control (GitHub), proper licensing (MIT), and containerization (Docker).

The assignment involves building and deploying a web application. Students are required to: 1. **Create a GitHub Repository:** Set up a public GitHub repository to store their code. 2. **Licensing:** Include an MIT LICENSE file in the repository. 3. **Develop and Test Code:** Write code that responds to POST and GET requests at specific endpoints (`/run?task=...` and `/read?path=...`), verifying correct functionality. 4. **Version Control:** Commit and push their code to the GitHub repository. 5. **Dockerize:** Create a `Dockerfile` to package their application into a Docker container image. 6. **Deployment:** Publish their Docker image publicly to Docker Hub. 7. **Testing Deployment:** Confirm their application works correctly when run via `podman` with port mapping. 8. **Submission:** Submit the URLs of their GitHub repository and Docker Hub image via a Google Form. Essentially, the assignment integrates software development, version control (using Git and GitHub), containerization (using Docker), and deployment. The use of `podman` suggests a focus on container runtime environments. The provided URLs are placeholders and should be replaced with the student's actual repository and image names.

The project must be a Dockerized application hosted on GitHub. Specifically: 1. **GitHub Repository:** The student's GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible. 2. **LICENSE File:** The repository must include a `LICENSE` file using the MIT license. This ensures the code is properly licensed. 3. **Dockerfile:** The repository needs a valid `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image. 4. **Publicly Accessible Docker Image:** The resulting Docker image must also be publicly accessible. 5. **Runnable Image:** The image must run successfully using the provided `podman` command. This command includes environment variables (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`) and port mapping (`8000:8000`). This implies the application runs on port 8000. 6. **Consistency:** The Dockerfile used to build the image must match the one in the GitHub repository, ensuring reproducibility. In short, the image outlines strict guidelines for project submission, emphasizing the importance of open-source practices, proper licensing, and reproducible builds using Docker. Students must meet all these criteria to have their project considered for evaluation.

The assignment requires students to: 1. **Create a public GitHub repository:** Students must create a publicly accessible repository on GitHub to store their code. 2. **Add an MIT license:** A standard MIT license file must be included in the repository, specifying the licensing terms of the software. 3. **Write and test code:** Students need to write code that interacts with a server using HTTP POST and GET requests to create and retrieve files. Specific endpoints `/run?task=` and `/read?path=` are defined. 4. **Commit and push code:** The completed code must be committed to and pushed to the GitHub repository. 5. **Create a Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile must be created to build a Docker image of the application. 6. **Publish Docker image:** The Docker image must be published publicly to Docker Hub, a container registry. 7. **Test Docker image:** Students must verify that running the Docker image (using `podman run`) with environment variables and port mapping serves the API correctly at the specified localhost addresses. 8. **Submit Google Form:** Finally, students must submit a Google Form with the URL of their GitHub repository and the name of their Docker image. This form acts as a submission point for the assignment. The submission includes both the source code (via GitHub) and the deployed application (via Docker Hub).", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/30", "type": "discourse_post"}

The steps involve: 1. **Creating a GitHub Repository:** Setting up a public repository to host the code. 2. **Code Development and Testing:** Writing and testing API functionality using POST and GET requests to `/run` and `/read` endpoints, respectively. The `/run` endpoint executes tasks, and `/read` retrieves results. 3. **Dockerization:** Creating a Dockerfile to package the application for easy deployment. 4. **Deployment to Docker Hub:** Publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub for public access. 5. **API Access and Authentication:** Utilizing the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication, which should *not* be committed to the repository for security reasons. The student is instructed to use the `os.environ` method to access the token within their script. A token limit is mentioned, and the student is encouraged to use the GPT-40-Mini model. 6. **Submission:** Submitting the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name via a Google Form. 7. **Performance Constraints:** The student is given a performance constraint: API calls must complete within 20 seconds. The overall structure is a step-by-step guide presented as a list of deliverables, with additional notes offering important clarifications, such as security best practices and model limitations. The star icons likely denote key sections or important milestones. The left-hand side shows the course structure and related sections, which gives context to this assignment being part of a larger program.

The request specifies the function (`extract_numbers_from_image`), input file path, and output file path (`/data/credit-card.txt`). The server processes the image and writes the extracted credit card number (without spaces) to the output file. A subsequent HTTP GET request retrieves the content of the output file. The final result shows the expected credit card number and the actual result. There's a slight discrepancy between the expected (4026399336539356) and the obtained (402639933635936) credit card numbers, indicating a potential error in the OCR or data processing.

{"id": "discourse_593709_0", "content": "Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

The module explains that using LLMs (like GPT-4) incurs a cost, and that students with an `iitm.ac.in` email address have been given API keys with a $1 monthly usage limit. Crucially, to avoid using their own OpenAI API keys directly, students are instructed to use an \"AI Proxy\" and are given specific instructions on how to replace their OpenAI API key and endpoint with the proxy's details. This is likely done for security and cost-management purposes within the course. The screenshot also shows a course navigation menu with other related topics like prompt engineering, various LLM analysis tools, and vision models.

It's broken into two steps: **Step 1: Store** This section demonstrates how to store documents in a vector database. It iterates through a list of `documents`. For each document, it uses the `ollama.embed()` function (likely a function from an embedding library like LlamaIndex or similar) to generate a vector embedding using the `\"mxbai-embed-large\"` model. The resulting embedding, along with the original document and a unique ID, is then added to a `collection` (presumably a vector database object). **Step 2: Retrieve** This section shows how to retrieve the most relevant document given a user query. An example query, \"What animals are llamas related to?\", is provided. The code generates an embedding for this query using the same `ollama.embed()` function and model. Then, `collection.query()` is used to search the database for the most relevant document based on the similarity of embeddings (n_results=1 means it only retrieves one result). Finally, `data` is assigned the retrieved document. **In a student context:** This code example would be useful for teaching or demonstrating concepts in: * **Information Retrieval:** Shows how vector embeddings are used for semantic search. * **Database Management:** Illustrates how data can be stored and queried efficiently using vector databases. * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Uses embeddings, a core concept in NLP, to understand semantic meaning and find relevant documents. * **Programming with Python:** Shows practical application of Python libraries and data structures. The code uses a simple approach. In a real-world scenario, more sophisticated techniques might be employed, like handling errors, implementing more advanced search strategies, or using different similarity metrics.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/125", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_594129_0", "content": "hi @carlton @Jivraj for A2 i am getting this particular error and i don’t know what i am doing wrong in this Screenshot from 2025-02-12 19-31-47 1501×564 44.7 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/6/463f25f29e9ac0e51e43914eb00cef2e89341c90_2_690x259.png [Caption] This image shows a log of a testing process, likely for a code formatter. A student could interpret it as follows: * **The Task:** The system is tasked with formatting a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using the `prettier` tool, version 3.4.2. The formatting happens \"in-place,\" meaning the original file is directly modified. * **HTTP Requests:** Two HTTP requests are made to a server (localhost:8000). * **POST Request:** This sends the formatting request to the server. The server's response (HTTP 200 OK) indicates success. The JSON payload shows the function called (\"format_file_with_prettier\"), the file path, and the Prettier version used. * **GET Request:** This retrieves the formatted file from the server after the formatting is complete. The server again responds successfully (HTTP 200 OK). * **Expected vs. Actual Results:** The `EXPECTED` section would likely contain the *expected* correctly formatted Markdown. The `RESULT` section shows the *actual* unformatted Markdown (before formatting), which demonstrates extra spaces and trailing whitespace. This implies the test checks whether the formatting process removes these unnecessary spaces. * **Markdown Example:** The unformatted Markdown shows an example of a paragraph with list items having inconsistent formatting. The `print(\"user@example.com\")` line seems unrelated and may be leftover code or part of a separate test case. In a student context, this image illustrates: * **Automated Testing:** The process demonstrates automated testing using a server-based system to test a code formatting tool. * **API Interaction:** The use of HTTP requests shows how software components can communicate using APIs. * **Code Formatting:** The example highlights the importance of code (or in this case, Markdown) formatting and the tools used to achieve consistency. * **Testing Methodology:** The image demonstrates a simple but effective test method comparing expected and actual output. The difference is the added spaces and whitespace. The image could be used in a computer science course covering testing, APIs, code formatting, or software development practices. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/6/463f25f29e9ac0e51e43914eb00cef2e89341c90.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work in a computer science or software engineering course. The code demonstrates a test case where a program formats a Markdown file using the Prettier code formatter. **Here's a breakdown for a student audience:** * **The Task:** The top line describes the goal: to automatically format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) using a specific version of Prettier (3.4.2). The formatting happens \"in-place,\" meaning the original file is directly modified. * **HTTP Requests:** The code interacts with a server (likely for testing or demonstration). A POST request sends the formatting instructions to the server, and a GET request retrieves the formatted file's contents. The \"200 OK\" responses indicate successful communication. * **JSON Response:** The server responds with JSON data showing which function was executed (\"format file with prettier\"), the file path, and the Prettier version used. * **Expected vs. Actual Output:** The \"EXPECTED\" section implies there should be a specific, correctly formatted Markdown output. The \"RESULT\" section shows the actual output received after formatting. The example output has extra spaces and trailing whitespace. This suggests a potential test failure if the program didn't remove these imperfections. * **Unformatted Markdown:** The \"Unformatted Markdown\" section demonstrates the original, poorly formatted Markdown file's contents. Note the extra spaces and irregular formatting (e.g., inconsistent bullet points). * **Python Snippet (Irrelevant):** The `print(\"user@example.com\")` line at the very end appears unrelated to the main task. It's likely a separate, unrelated piece of code that accidentally made it into the image. In short, this image captures a testing scenario within a larger software development context. The student likely implemented a function to format Markdown files, and this image shows a test case to evaluate the function's ability to correctly format the file according to the formatting rules set by Prettier. The discrepancy between the expected and actual output indicates a potential bug or issue in the code that needs to be resolved.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/157", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_594133_0", "content": "you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file? Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-56 1501×564 61.8 KB [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/1/8/18e7419bec3e953904b029c887a657f57b376377.png [Caption] This image shows a Python code snippet within a code editor. The code defines two asynchronous functions, `a2` and `a3`. Function `a2` takes an email string and a file path (defaulting to `/data/format.md`) as input. It uses the `subprocess` module to run the `prettier` code formatter on the specified Markdown file. The function then reads the formatted file and compares it to the original content. It returns `True` if the formatted content matches the expected output and a mismatch message otherwise. The comment notes the use of `shell=True`, which should be used cautiously due to security risks associated with shell injection. Function `a3` (partially shown) appears to take an email as input and likely retrieves dates from it using a function `get_dates`. The bottom of the image displays tabs for \"Problems,\" \"Output,\" \"Debug Console,\" \"Terminal,\" and \"Ports,\" common elements in many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). This suggests a student is working on a project or assignment involving file formatting and potentially data extraction from email. The code is likely part of an automated test or a task within a larger program. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/8/18e7419bec3e953904b029c887a657f57b376377_2_690x259.png [Caption] This image shows a Python code snippet within a code editor (likely VS Code). The code defines two asynchronous functions, `a2` and `a3` (only `a2` is fully shown). Function `a2` takes an email and a file path as input. It uses the `subprocess` module to run the `prettier` code formatter (version 3.4.2) on the specified Markdown file (`/data/format.md`). The code explicitly handles the possibility that `npx` (Node Package Executor) needs to be found in the system's PATH, particularly on Windows. The function then reads the formatted file, compares it to the original content, and returns `True` if the formatting was successful (no mismatch), implying a test function for code formatting. The incomplete `a3` function suggests additional testing functionality. The bottom of the image shows tabs for different IDE views (Problems, Output, Debug Console, Terminal, Ports). In the context of a student, this would likely be an example of: * **Automated testing:** The code demonstrates how to write automated tests to verify the correctness of a code formatter. * **System calls:** It shows how to execute external commands from Python using `subprocess`. * **File I/O:** Reading and writing files are crucial aspects demonstrated here. * **Asynchronous programming:** The use of `async` and `await` keywords indicates asynchronous operations which are beneficial when dealing with I/O bound tasks. * **Error handling (implicit):** While not explicitly shown, the comparison suggests implicit error handling through the mismatch check. A student might encounter this code in a course on software testing, scripting, or system administration, or as part of a larger project involving code formatting or automated testing. The comments further enhance the understanding, especially for a student new to the concepts.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/160", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student in a computer science or related field would recognize this as the log output of a program being run using `podman`, a containerization technology. Specifically: * **`podman run ...`**: This command starts a container. The various options (`-e`, `-p`) set environment variables and port mappings, respectively. The important part is that the user is running a containerized application. * **`AIPROXY_TOKEN`**: This suggests the application uses some form of authentication or authorization. * **`8000:8000`**: This indicates that port 8000 on the host machine is mapped to port 8000 inside the container. This is commonly used for web servers. * **`tds-project-pradeep-mondal`**: This is likely the name or identifier of the container image being run, suggesting a student project. * **`INFO: Started server process [1]`**: The application's server process has started successfully. * **`INFO: Waiting for application startup.`**: The application is initializing. * **`INFO: Application startup complete.`**: The application has finished loading. * **`INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`**: This signifies that a web server (Uvicorn, a popular ASGI server for Python) is running and accessible at the specified address. In short, the image demonstrates the successful deployment and startup of a student's containerized application. The application is likely a web application given the use of Uvicorn and port 8000. The command line shows proficiency in using container technology and the log shows successful start-up and availability. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/e/0e724c8ad15be3f5051e9abaf562830a2a1217ec.png [Caption] This image shows a command-line instruction for students working with containerized applications (likely in a DevOps or software engineering context). Let's break down what it means: * **`podman run`**: This is a command to run a container using the Podman container engine. Podman is an alternative to Docker. * **`$IMAGE_NAME`**: This is a placeholder representing the name of the Docker image containing the application. Students would replace this with the actual image name (e.g., `my-api-image:latest`). * **`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`**: This sets an environment variable within the container. `AIPROXY_TOKEN` likely holds an authentication token needed for the application to work correctly. The `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` part means this token should be pulled from an existing environment variable. * **`-p 8000:8000`**: This maps port 8000 on the host machine (your computer) to port 8000 inside the container. This allows you to access the application running inside the container from your browser. * **`automatically`**: This indicates that the process described by this command will handle the setup automatically, meaning you don't have to manually do additional configurations. * **`serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`**: This explains that once the command is executed, an API (Application Programming Interface) will be accessible at the given URL. The `...` indicates additional parameters might be added after `task`. In summary, this snippet instructs students how to start a containerized application, configuring its environment variables and exposing a specific port for access. The students need to provide their image name and API token to make this command executable.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/202", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break it down for a student: * **`uvicorn app:app`**: This is the command used to start the server. `uvicorn` is the server itself. `app:app` specifies the Python module (`app`) and the application object within that module to run. * **`--host 127.0.0.1`**: This sets the server to listen only on the local machine (localhost). `127.0.0.1` is the loopback IP address. * **`--port 8000`**: This sets the port number the server will use to communicate. Port 8000 is commonly used for development. * **`Finished server process [30576]` and `Started server process [5584]`**: These lines show that a previous server process (with ID 30576) was stopped and a new one (with ID 5584) was started. This might happen if the server was restarted. * **`Waiting for application startup.` and `Application startup complete.`**: These messages indicate the server is initializing and the application code is loading. * **`Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`**: This is a confirmation message showing the server is up and running at the specified address and port. It tells the user how to stop the server. * **`127.0.0.1:54184 \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK`**: This is a log of a successful HTTP request. * `127.0.0.1:54184`: The client IP address and port that made the request. * `\"GET / HTTP/1.1\"`: The type of request (GET) and the path requested (`/`, the root path). * `200 OK`: The HTTP status code indicating a successful response. In short, this output demonstrates the successful startup and operation of a simple web application built using Python and the `uvicorn` server. It highlights key concepts like server processes, IP addresses, ports, HTTP requests, and status codes, all relevant in web development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/220", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is encountering a \"Not Found\" error in their web application, as seen in the browser window displaying `\"detail\":\"Not Found\"`. The main part of the image shows the student's code editor, displaying a Python file (`app.py`) that uses the FastAPI library. This code defines an API endpoint that returns a message (\"Hello from the Automation Agent!\") when accessed via a GET request to the root path (`/`). It also includes a DELETE endpoint (`/delete`) and uses logging to record deletion attempts. The code also appears to handle API proxy tokens for authentication. The terminal window shows that the student has recently pushed their code changes to a remote Git repository (`git push origin main`). The output indicates successful upload with details about objects enumerated, counted, compressed, and pushed. The overall process suggests a student developing, debugging, and deploying a simple web service using FastAPI and Git. The error suggests the student needs to address a routing issue in their application.

The main focus is on a Python code file (`app.py`) within a VS Code editor. The code uses the FastAPI framework to create a simple web API. A key part is error handling for an API token, requiring it to be set as an environment variable. The API has a GET endpoint (`/`) returning a \"Hello\" message and a DELETE endpoint (`/delete`) which likely has logging enabled for auditing. The terminal window at the bottom displays the successful execution of a `git push` command, indicating that the student committed and uploaded their code changes to a remote repository on GitHub. The browser window shows a \"Not Found\" error, suggesting that the student is testing the API and hasn't yet implemented or correctly configured the endpoint being accessed. Overall, the image captures a common scenario for students learning web development: writing, testing, and deploying code.

The student, whose username is \"vikramjncasr,\" is using the `ls /` command to list the contents of the root directory. The output shows a list of common Linux directories, each with a specific purpose: * **`/bin`**: Contains essential executable files for all users. * **`/boot`**: Contains files required for booting the system. * **`/etc`**: Contains configuration files for the system. * **`/home`**: Contains user home directories. * **`/lib`**, **`/lib64`**: Contain system libraries. * **`/media`**: Mount point for removable media. * **`/mnt`**: Mount point for temporary filesystems. * **`/proc`**: A virtual filesystem containing information about the running processes. * **`/root`**: The root user's home directory. * **`/run`**: Contains files related to the currently running system. * **`/sbin`**: Contains essential executable files for system administrators. * **`/srv`**: Contains data for services. * **`/sys`**: Contains information about the hardware and devices. * **`/tmp`**: Contains temporary files. * **`/usr`**: Contains most of the user-space programs and data. * **`/var`**: Contains variable data, such as log files and databases. The `.usr-is-merged` directories are likely a result of a specific system configuration or package management process, where user-related files and directories are merged into a single location. The command is run from a directory under `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`. This suggests the student might be working on a project for the IIT Madras TDS Project within a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/5/2/529a3326ad0a3a4a60a7c95b080336814e487f6c_2_690x62.png [Caption] This image shows the output of a `ls /` command in a Linux terminal. The `ls` command lists the contents of a directory, and `/` represents the root directory – the top-level directory of the file system. For a student learning about operating systems or file systems, this is a key image. It shows the main directories within a Linux system's root directory. Each directory has a specific purpose: * **bin:** Contains essential executable commands. * **boot:** Contains files related to booting the system. * **etc:** Contains system-wide configuration files. * **init:** Contains initialization scripts. * **lib:** Contains shared libraries. * **lib64:** Contains 64-bit shared libraries. * **lost+found:** Contains files recovered after a file system error. * **mnt:** Mount point for temporary file systems. * **proc:** Contains information about running processes. * **root:** The home directory of the root user. * **run:** Contains runtime files. * **sbin:** Contains essential system administration executables. * **srv:** Contains data for services. * **sys:** Contains system-related files. * **tmp:** Contains temporary files. * **usr:** Contains user-related programs and files. * **var:** Contains variable data (logs, databases etc.). * **dev:** Contains device files. * **home:** Contains user home directories. * **media:** Mount points for removable media. * **opt:** Contains optional software packages. * **sbin:** Contains system binaries (similar to bin, but for privileged users). * **snap:** Contains snap packages. The output also shows the user's current directory and username (`vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA`). The `bin.usr-is-merged` and `sbin.usr-is-merged` directories suggest a system with merged user and system directories, a common practice for packaging and deployment. Overall, it provides a fundamental view of the Linux file system hierarchy.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/236", "type": "discourse_post"}

They've entered an incorrect password multiple times, resulting in error messages (\"Sorry, try again.\" and \"sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts\"). After the failed login attempts, the student is trying to use `sudo` to update the system (`sudo apt update`), and install `podman` (`sudo apt install -y podman`). The multiple attempts suggest the student is having trouble remembering their password.

The student is attempting to use `sudo` (superuser do) to execute several commands: `apt update`, `passwd` (to change their password), and `apt install -y podman` (to install the podman container engine). However, the student is repeatedly entering the wrong password. The terminal displays \"Sorry, try again.\" after each incorrect attempt, and eventually shows a message indicating three incorrect password attempts. Even when prompted again, the student fails to provide the correct password. This highlights a common issue for students learning to use the command line; they may not yet know their system's password or may have made a typo.

The task was to extract a credit card number from an image (`/data/credit_card.png`), and save it to a file (`/data/credit-card.txt`). The log shows several errors: 1. **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error):** The initial attempt to extract the credit card number failed because the image file was not found at the specified location. The server reported that the file does not exist at the path specified in the error message. 2. **HTTP 404 (Not Found):** A subsequent attempt to read the `/data/credit-card.txt` file failed because the file was not found. This is likely because the previous step (extracting the number from the image) failed. 3. **A8 failed:** Indicates a failure within a specific process (A8) which tried to read the `credit-card.txt` file, likely confirming the absence of the file. 4. **HTTP 401 (Unauthorized):** A request to an external service (`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`) failed due to unauthorized access. This suggests that the API key or authentication for this external service was incorrect or missing. 5. **A9 failed:** A further failure (A9) likely related to the previous unauthorized access, as it failed with the message `'data'`, suggesting a problem with data handling or retrieval from the unauthorized API. In summary, this log demonstrates a debugging process where multiple attempts to complete the task failed due to a combination of file not found errors, and unauthorized access to an external API. The student would likely need to fix the file paths and/or API credentials to resolve these issues.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/250", "type": "discourse_post"}

While the student was working in VSCode, likely writing code (as evidenced by the code snippets visible), the application became unresponsive. The error message \"The window is not responding\" appeared, giving the student three options: * **Reopen:** Restart the VSCode application. This might recover the work if the unsaved changes are not lost. * **Close:** Close the VSCode application without saving. This means any unsaved work will be lost. * **Keep Waiting:** Continue waiting to see if VSCode recovers on its own. This is usually not recommended, as it can lead to data loss. The checkbox \"Don't restore editors\" allows the student to prevent VSCode from attempting to reload any open files and editors upon restarting. This might be helpful if the application is experiencing significant issues. The bottom shows a terminal window, likely using Powershell.

For a student, this is relevant because it illustrates the cost associated with using these powerful language models for projects or applications. **Key takeaways for a student:** * **GPT-40:** This is a high-intelligence model suitable for complex tasks. It's significantly more expensive than GPT-40 mini. The costs are broken down by input, cached input (previously processed data), and output, all priced per million tokens (a unit of text). * **GPT-40 mini:** This is a more affordable option designed for everyday tasks. It still offers a substantial 128k context length (meaning it can \"remember\" a large amount of prior conversation), but at a lower cost per token. * **Cost considerations:** The image emphasizes that using these models is not free. Students would need to budget accordingly if they intend to use the API for their projects. The cost difference between GPT-40 and GPT-40 mini might influence their choice depending on their project requirements and budget. * **Tokens:** Students should understand that \"tokens\" are units of text used to measure the input and output of the models. The cost is directly proportional to the number of tokens used. In short, the image provides a crucial understanding of the financial implications of utilizing OpenAI's powerful language models for student projects, highlighting the trade-off between capability and cost.

For students, this is relevant because it demonstrates the cost associated with using these powerful language models for projects or applications. **Key points for students:** * **GPT-40:** This is described as a \"high-intelligence model for complex tasks,\" implying greater capability but also a higher price. The cost is broken down by the number of tokens (units of text) processed for input, cached input (previously processed text that can be reused), and output. * **GPT-40 mini:** This is presented as a more affordable, smaller model suitable for everyday tasks. The pricing is significantly lower than GPT-40, making it a potentially more accessible option for students with budget constraints. * **Token-based pricing:** The pricing structure is based on the number of tokens used, meaning the cost increases with the amount of text processed. Students should understand that longer inputs and outputs will be more expensive. This incentivizes efficient use of the models. * **Context length:** Both models have a 128k context length. This refers to the amount of text the model can \"remember\" during a single interaction. This is an important factor when considering model choice for tasks involving lengthy inputs. In short, this image provides students with valuable information about the financial aspects of utilizing OpenAI's powerful language models, allowing them to make informed decisions based on their project requirements and budget.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/280", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is attempting to use the `subprocess` module to run a Python script located at a remote URL. The code first defines the URL of the script (`script_url`) and an argument (`arg`) to pass to it. It then uses `wget` (within `subprocess`) to download the script, and finally attempts to execute it using `subprocess.run()`. The script is intended to accept a single email address as a command-line argument. The terminal output shows that the `wget` portion successfully downloaded the script. However, the attempt to run the downloaded script failed with a `NameError`, indicating that the `subprocess` module was not imported in the script itself (despite being imported in the main script). This is a common error for beginners learning about modules and imports in Python. The student is likely working on a project involving external scripts or potentially exploring different ways to run external processes from a Python program. The `_main__` and `CompletedProcess` output further illustrate attempts at running the external script and highlight the error. The long URL indicates the script may be part of a larger online course or learning project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/d/3dacf2bf3fd48309342a483aeb249f46faf1dc55_2_690x364.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student's work in a Python programming environment, likely VS Code. The student is working on a script (`lim.py`) that uses the `subprocess` module to download and execute another Python script (`datagen.py`) located on a remote GitHub repository. The `lim.py` script first defines the URL of `datagen.py` and a command-line argument. It then uses the `wget` command (via `subprocess.run`) to download the remote script. Finally, it executes the downloaded script using `subprocess.run`, passing the defined argument. The output window shows that the script successfully downloaded the file and attempted to run it. However, there's an error indicating that the `subprocess` module was not imported within `datagen.py` itself, causing the execution to fail. This highlights a common beginner mistake in programming: forgetting to import necessary modules. The output also shows HTTP requests, suggesting that the `datagen.py` script likely interacts with a web service. The overall context suggests the student is learning about: * **Subprocesses:** Executing external commands or scripts from within a Python program. * **Remote File Access:** Downloading files from a URL. * **Module Importing:** Correctly including necessary libraries. * **Error Handling:** Identifying and debugging runtime errors. * **Command-Line Arguments:** Passing arguments to scripts. The error in the output provides a valuable learning opportunity for the student to practice debugging and understand the importance of proper module importation.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/305", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is using a terminal and an IDE (likely VS Code) to run a Python script (`datagen.py`). The script appears to download another Python script from a GitHub repository and then execute it, passing an email address as an argument. The `subprocess` module is being used to run external commands. The terminal output shows the script successfully running and a web request being made (HTTP POST request). The comments in the code clearly indicate the script's purpose and the intended workflow, suggesting the student is working on a project that involves data processing and potentially automated emailing. The `DISCLAIMER` comment in the terminal output suggests this code is a preliminary version for testing or learning purposes. The overall context is likely a data science or related programming course assignment or project. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/e/ae2a4772672aef536d8e69b87e59e4f94853ebc8.png [Caption] This image shows a student's Python programming environment, specifically illustrating the execution of a Python script using a Unix-like shell (likely within Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL). Let's break down the key elements relevant to a student: **1. Code (llm.py):** The core code uses the `subprocess` module to run external commands. It first prints the absolute path of a `/data` directory (likely containing input data for the script). Then, it: * **Downloads a script:** It fetches a Python script (`datagen.py`) from a GitHub repository using `curl`. This demonstrates the use of external resources and version control (GitHub). * **Executes the downloaded script:** It runs the downloaded script (`datagen.py`) using the `uv` command (likely a process manager or wrapper), passing an email address as an argument. This shows how to interact with other scripts and pass arguments. * **Error Handling:** The `check=True` argument in `subprocess.run` ensures that the script's execution is checked for errors; any non-zero exit code from the subprocess will raise an exception. **2. Terminal Output:** The terminal shows the output of the executed commands. Key information: * **Server Startup:** Messages indicate the starting and successful completion of a server process (likely a web server to handle incoming requests). * **Script Execution:** The output includes information about the downloaded script's execution, file creation, and data transfer statistics. It also notes a disclaimer stating the script is subject to change. * **HTTP Request:** A successful HTTP POST request is shown, suggesting the server is communicating with another service (potentially for data processing or submission). **3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** The image shows a code editor (possibly VS Code or similar) with file explorer, outlining features, and a debugging console. These are standard IDE features used for efficient code writing, organization, and debugging. **4. Project Structure:** The file explorer shows a well-organized project directory with files such as `app.py`, `llm.py`, `datagen.py`, and a `Dockerfile` (indicating potential containerization for deployment). **Educational Relevance for a Student:** This image provides a strong example of: * **Modular Programming:** Using separate scripts (`app.py`, `datagen.py`) and connecting their execution. * **External Libraries/Modules:** Employing `os` and `subprocess` for system interactions. * **Version Control (GitHub):** Fetching code from a repository showcases the importance of version control in collaborative projects. * **Error Handling:** The `check=True` parameter highlights the importance of error handling in robust programs. * **Data Processing Pipeline:** The sequence of actions suggests a data processing pipeline where data is obtained, processed, and potentially submitted to a remote service. * **Deployment Aspects (Dockerfile):** The presence of a Dockerfile introduces concepts relevant to deploying applications in a consistent environment. Overall, this image represents a sophisticated student project, incorporating multiple advanced programming concepts and demonstrating a good understanding of system interactions and best practices.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/348", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_595170_0", "content": "Screenshot 2025-02-15 075843 1919×1017 70.9 KB is changes is required in Dockerfile [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/2/d2cb339eab8983304f220c258a57f4db8cd76213.png [Caption] This image shows a student's terminal session using Docker to run a Python application. Let's break down the key aspects relevant to a student's understanding: **1. Project Setup:** The student is working on a project with several files: `app.py` (main application), `datagen.py` (likely data generation script), `re.txt` (requirements file), and a `Dockerfile`. The project appears to be structured within a virtual environment (`ilm_venv`). **2. Dockerfile:** The `Dockerfile` is crucial. It defines how the application's environment is built and run within a Docker container. The steps include: * **Base Image:** Uses a slim Python 3.12 image. This ensures consistency across different environments. * **Dependencies:** Installs `curl` and `ca-certificates` (essential for downloading things securely) and project dependencies listed in `re.txt` (using `pip`). * **Installer Script:** Downloads and executes an installer script (`/uv-installer.sh`), which suggests the application relies on a specific third-party tool or library. * **Environment Variables:** Sets the `PATH` to include the location where the application's executable will be installed. * **Working Directory:** Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. * **Copying Files:** Copies the necessary files (`re.txt`, `app.py`) into the container's `/app` directory. * **Command to Run:** Specifies the command `uv run app.py` to start the application within the container. `uv` likely refers to a specific application runner. **3. Application Execution:** The terminal output shows the application starting up, waiting for startup, and completing startup. Then there's a successful execution that includes a POST request to a raw githubusercontent URL. The application seems to be using uvicorn, a popular ASGI server for Python. **4. Learning Outcomes:** A student looking at this image can learn about: * **Docker:** Containerization for reproducible environments. * **Virtual Environments:** Isolating project dependencies. * **Python Programming:** Using Python for application development. * **Package Management:** Installing dependencies with `pip`. * **Shell Scripting:** The use of the installer script demonstrates basic shell scripting knowledge. * **Networking:** A HTTP POST request is being made suggesting knowledge of networking. * **Deployment:** The setup aims for efficient deployment of the application. **In short:** The image showcases a relatively advanced student project that combines several key concepts in software development, especially Docker for deployment and the application deployment itself. The POST request suggests a web service element as well. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/2/d2cb339eab8983304f220c258a57f4db8cd76213_2_690x365.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work using VS Code to develop and run a Python application within a Docker container. Here's a breakdown for a student context: * **Dockerfile:** The file on the left contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base Python image, installs necessary packages (including `curl` and possibly others), downloads and runs an installer (possibly for a specific Python library or application), sets environment variables (like adding the application's directory to the PATH), copies application files (`app.py`, `re.txt`), and finally defines the command to run the application (`CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]`). This demonstrates knowledge of Docker and creating reproducible environments. * **app.py (and possibly re.txt):** These are the Python application files, not directly visible but implied by the `COPY` commands in the Dockerfile. `re.txt` might contain requirements or other setup information. * **Terminal Output:** The bottom pane shows the application running successfully. The output indicates the server starting, application startup completion, and the URL where the application is accessible. The `CompletedProcess` line shows successful execution and the final HTTP request made by the application. * **Overall:** This screenshot shows a complete workflow, from building a Docker image using a `Dockerfile` to running a Python application inside that container. The student is likely working on a project that involves deploying a Python application, possibly for a web service or other server-side task. The use of Docker suggests an understanding of containerization and its benefits (reproducibility, dependency management, etc.). The terminal output shows successful deployment and indicates that the student's application is communicating with an external service (likely for data upload).", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/350", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is likely working on a Python program (`taskA2.py`, `evaluate.py`) that processes data, specifically a file named `credit-card.png`. The program appears to be interacting with an external service (`https://alproxy.sanand.workers.dev`) to perform some operation (possibly an HTTP POST request). The output shows a test failure. The program expected a specific output (`4390652220367260078`), but the actual result (`4390652220367260`) was different, causing a test failure. Furthermore, the HTTP request also failed. The file system explorer shows several other data files that might be relevant to the assignment. The overall context indicates a debugging session where the student is trying to resolve issues with their program's data processing and external API interaction.

The student is likely working on a project involving data processing and web requests. The screen displays several files, including a `.png` image and several `.txt` and `.json` files, suggesting data handling is part of the assignment. There is also Python code, indicated by the `.py` files, suggesting a Python-based programming environment. The central part of the screen shows output from a program, highlighting a failure in two parts of the code (A8 and A9). The error messages indicate a mismatch between the expected and actual result of some data processing (\"EXPECTED\" vs. \"RESULT\"). The failure of A9 appears related to a POST HTTP request, implying an attempt to send data to a server. The specific error message for A9 (\"'data'\") suggests a problem in how the data is formatted or sent. The student needs to debug their code to resolve these issues and make the program work correctly. The screen shows a debugging console and other tools to assist in this process. The numbers \"390 6522 2036 7260\" displayed prominently on the screen may be relevant data for the program, but their significance is unclear without more context.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/359", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student in a computer science or web development class would recognize this as an error response. Specifically: * **500 Internal Server Error:** This indicates a problem on the server side. While the error message itself is a 401 (Unauthorized), the server is reporting a 500, suggesting a problem in how the server is handling the 401 error. This might be a bug in the server's error handling. * **Error code: 401:** This is the actual error. 401 means \"Unauthorized\". The user's authentication token (like a password or API key) is invalid or not coming from an approved source. * **'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'** This is a clear explanation of the problem. The server doesn't recognize the authentication token because it wasn't generated by a trusted source. * **JSON Response:** The error details are formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common data format for web APIs. In summary, this screenshot demonstrates a common problem in web development: authentication failure. The mismatch between the 500 and 401 status codes points to a potential bug on the server side. A student might be asked to debug this, focusing on either the client-side authentication (making sure the token is generated correctly) or the server-side code (ensuring correct handling of 401 errors).", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/362", "type": "discourse_post"}

It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it. Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

The error message indicates that the Python environment is externally managed by the system's package manager (pacman). The terminal output provides several solutions: 1. **System-wide installation:** The student can use `pacman -S python-numpy` to install NumPy system-wide. This is the recommended approach for Arch Linux. 2. **Virtual environment:** If the student needs a separate Python environment, they can create one using `python -m venv path/to/venv` and then install NumPy within that environment using `path/to/venv/bin/pip install numpy`. This isolates the installation and prevents conflicts with other projects. 3. **pipx:** For installing Python applications, `pipx install numpy` is suggested, as it automatically manages virtual environments. This method requires having `python-pipx` installed via `pacman`. The error message also includes a note about contacting the Python installation or OS distribution provider if the error is unexpected and a hint referencing PEP 668 for a deeper understanding of the issue. Finally, the student successfully installs NumPy after creating a virtual environment and using the correct `pip` command within that environment. This demonstrates a successful resolution to the initial error. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/5/15e33e0ab5319a089a3cf734a66b3318dc7d08ac_2_690x181.png [Caption] This image shows a terminal session where a student is trying to install the NumPy library using `pip3 install numpy` on a Linux system (Arch Linux). The system, however, is preventing the installation because Python is managed externally, likely by the system's package manager (pacman in this case). The error message explains that to install Python packages system-wide, one should use the system's package manager (`pacman -S python-xyz`). Alternatively, the student is advised to create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv path/to/venv` to avoid conflicts with the system's Python installation. Using `pip` within a virtual environment is the recommended approach. The message also suggests using `pipx` for installing Python applications. The student then tries a different approach by activating a virtual environment (`source /home/jaldeep/python3/bin/activate`) and then tries installing NumPy again. This time the installation succeeds because the requirements are already met within the activated virtual environment. The last line shows the command prompt in the activated virtual environment. In short, the image depicts a common issue encountered when working with Python on systems with pre-installed Python versions. It highlights the importance of using virtual environments for managing project dependencies and avoiding conflicts with system-level packages.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/374", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is trying to embed the words \"king\" and \"queen\" using the `text-embedding-3-small` model. The command includes headers for the content type and authorization, using a variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` for the bearer token. However, the request failed with a \"Missing Authorization: Bearer header\" error. This indicates the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` variable is likely not properly set or the authorization header is not formatted correctly. The error message also provides a helpful link to a GitHub repository, which likely contains further documentation or instructions. The student needs to check their API key and ensure it's correctly set in the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before retrying the request.

Let's break down the key elements for a student audience: * **API Call:** The core action is a `curl` command. This is a command-line tool used to transfer data to and from servers using various protocols, in this case, making a POST request to an API. The API endpoint is `/openai/v1/embeddings`, suggesting it's an API designed to generate embeddings (numerical representations) of text. * **OpenAI Embeddings:** The API likely takes text as input and returns a vector (a list of numbers). This vector represents the meaning or semantic content of the input text. These embeddings are crucial for tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and clustering similar text. * **Input:** The input to the API is explicitly shown as `[\"king\", \"queen\"]`. The API is generating embeddings for these two words. * **API Key:** The API key (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`) is obfuscated but essential for authentication and access. Real-world APIs require secure keys to prevent unauthorized use. * **Output:** The output displays a JSON response structured as a list containing an object with an `embedding` field. This field contains a vector of numbers representing the embedding for the word \"king\". The `index` field indicates this is the embedding at position 0. * **Progress Bar:** The top section provides a progress bar showing the download progress of the API response. * **Context:** The user has likely set an environment variable (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`) containing their API key for easier use. They are probably working on a natural language processing (NLP) project or a machine learning application that needs to understand the relationship between words or phrases. **In summary:** This image depicts a common task in NLP and machine learning: obtaining vector representations (embeddings) of words from an API. It highlights the use of command-line tools, API calls, JSON data structures, and authentication tokens—all essential concepts in the field of computer science and data science.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/411", "type": "discourse_post"}

This line would print an email address to the console. This is likely part of a larger program, illustrating a basic programming concept. The overall context suggests a student learning about: * **Markdown formatting:** The poorly formatted `format.md` file directly highlights the importance of proper Markdown syntax and clean formatting. * **Python programming:** The `app.py` file shows a basic Python print statement, possibly as an example in a larger lesson. * **File management:** The code editor shows multiple files within a project, demonstrating the organization of code in a project environment.

It represents a Python project named \"TDS-Project-1\". Let's break down the key aspects relevant to a student: * **Project Structure:** The project is organized into folders and files. The use of `_pycache_` folders indicates that Python caching is enabled (these folders store compiled bytecode for faster execution). The `.venv` folder shows a virtual environment is used, isolating the project's dependencies from the system's Python installation. This is good practice for project management. * **Python Files:** The project contains several `.py` files: `__init__.py` (likely initializing the `app` package), `funtion_tasks.py` (suggests functions performing specific tasks), and `main.py` (likely the main entry point of the program). `evaluate.py` likely contains code for evaluating the results of the project. `datagen.py` presumably generates data used by the program. * **Other Files:** `task_to_embed.txt` suggests a text file containing data to be embedded or processed. `.gitignore` specifies files and directories to exclude from version control (like the `_pycache_` folders). `Dockerfile` indicates the project is designed to be containerized using Docker, a valuable skill in modern software development. `README.md` and `LICENSE` files are standard for open-source projects, containing descriptions and licensing information. * **Version Control Hints:** The \"2, U\" and \"3, U\" next to `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py` respectively, suggest a version control system (like Git) is in use; the numbers possibly showing the number of changes, and the \"U\" potentially indicating that the files are uncommitted changes that need to be pushed to the repository. **In summary:** This image depicts a well-structured Python project, utilizing best practices like virtual environments and version control, suitable for a student learning about software engineering principles. The project seems to focus on data generation and processing.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/451", "type": "discourse_post"}

For a student learning about web development or API interactions, this is a crucial example of how errors are communicated. Specifically: * **HTTP Status Code:** The response shows a `401` error code, indicating an \"Unauthorized\" request. This means the server didn't accept the request due to insufficient authentication. * **Error Detail:** The `detail` field contains a nested JSON structure providing more specific information about the error. The core message is that the \"authentication token is not from a valid issuer\". This points to a problem with the security token (like a JWT or API key) used to authenticate the request. The token may have expired, been tampered with, or been generated by an unauthorized source. * **JSON Structure:** The response is formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common standard for data exchange between web servers and clients. Students should recognize the key-value pairs and nested objects. * **Debugging Context:** This image would be shown in a debugging environment, like a browser's developer tools, which allow developers to inspect network requests and responses. Understanding such responses is essential for fixing authentication problems in applications.

Just do what @carlton mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1! x.com Aakash Gupta @aakashg0 Most people are still prompting wrong. I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

It's useful for students learning about how to effectively structure prompts to get the desired results. The prompt asks for a list of three lesser-known medium-length hikes near San Francisco, each detailed with specific information (name, addresses, distance, times, and unique features). The image is broken into four key sections: * **Goal:** This clearly states the overall objective: find three unique, medium-length hikes near San Francisco. * **Return Format:** Specifies the exact format the LLM should use for the response – a structured list of details for each hike. This is crucial for ensuring the LLM returns the information in a usable manner. * **Warnings:** Highlights the need for accuracy, emphasizing the importance of verifying the hike's existence and the correctness of the times provided. This section demonstrates that anticipating potential errors and including instructions to prevent them is important in prompt engineering. * **Context Dump:** Provides background information relevant to the request, helping the LLM understand the user's preferences and constraints (e.g., familiarity with local hikes, desire for ocean views, a unique experience due to a short-term separation). This shows how adding contextual information improves the relevance and quality of the response. In short, the image serves as a template and example of a well-structured prompt. Students can learn from this how to craft effective prompts that yield accurate and useful results by focusing on clear goals, precise output specifications, error prevention, and relevant background information.

A student might see this in a context of: * **Web Application Development:** The image shows a web interface likely connected to a backend service that executes code. The address `127.0.0.1:8000` suggests a local development server. The `task=Install` parameter indicates an installation process was triggered. The JSON response confirms a successful execution of a script from a GitHub repository. This is relevant to learning about APIs, web server communication, and deployment. * **Data Science/Python Programming:** The script (`datagen.py`) located in a GitHub repository suggests a data generation task. This is common in data science projects where synthetic data is needed for testing or model training. The use of email within the execution points to possible user authentication or notification processes. * **DevOps/Automation:** The automated execution of a script via a web interface highlights the use of automation in software development and deployment. The combination of a web application and Python script underscores the integration of different technologies. In short, the image depicts a successful automated execution of a Python data generation script through a locally hosted web application, illustrating concepts from web development, data science, and potentially DevOps. The JSON response is a standard way to communicate the success or failure of such operations.

The user is viewing the contents of a folder named \"data\" located on their Acer computer (C: drive). The window displays a list of files and folders within the \"data\" folder. These files include various types, such as text files (.txt), a JSON file, a PNG image, and a database file. The file explorer also shows other folders on the computer's main directory, such as \"Pictures\", \"Documents\", and \"Downloads\", as well as a folder seemingly containing student assignments (\"TDS assignments 4\"). The file sizes and last modified dates are also visible, indicating recent activity. The image suggests a student's work related to a project or assignment, possibly involving data analysis or programming, based on the filenames and file types. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/2/622e4a15020aefe140e92f8aa38035c5518ae41a_2_690x354.png [Caption] This image shows a file explorer window on a Windows computer. The window displays the contents of a folder named \"data\" located on the C: drive. The folder contains various files and subfolders, including: * **Folders:** `docs`, `logs` * **Files:** `comments` (text file), `contacts` (JSON file), `credit_card` (PNG image), `dates` (text file), `email` (text file), `format` (Markdown file), and `ticket-sales` (database file). The file explorer shows the file name, date modified, file type, and file size for each item. The date modified is consistent (February 16th, 2025, around 11:56-11:58 AM). This could be relevant to a student in a computing or data science class as an example of file organization and file types encountered in projects. The presence of files like `contacts`, `dates`, and `ticket-sales` hints that this data might be related to a project involving data management or analysis. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/5/65498f6319cf654240d6dbf5f62a9313ebd5fd41.png [Caption] This Python code snippet ensures that all data files for a project are stored within a subdirectory named \"data\" located in the project's root directory. Let's break it down line by line for a student: * **Line 35:** This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following code. It clarifies that the goal is to manage data files centrally within a \"data\" folder. * **Line 36:** This line defines a variable `PROJECT_ROOT`. It uses the `os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())` function to determine the absolute path of the current working directory (where the script is running). This ensures the code works regardless of where it's executed from. * **Line 37:** This line defines a variable `DATA_DIR`. It uses `os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, \"data\")` to create the path to the \"data\" subdirectory *within* the `PROJECT_ROOT` directory. `os.path.join` is crucial because it handles operating system specific path separators correctly (e.g., `/` on Linux/macOS, `\\` on Windows). * **Line 38:** This is a blank line for readability. * **Line 39:** Another comment indicating that the next line will create the \"data\" directory if it doesn't already exist. * **Line 40:** This line uses `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` to create the \"data\" directory. The `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error from being raised if the directory already exists. This makes the code more robust. In essence, this code snippet is a best practice for organizing data in a Python project. By centralizing data files in a consistent location, it enhances code maintainability and prevents issues caused by different data file locations.

A student might see this in a class on data science, programming, or web development. Here's a breakdown for a student: * **The URL:** The address bar shows a URL starting with `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install...`. This indicates a local server (127.0.0.1 is the localhost address) is running a task, likely related to installing or running a program. The URL also contains a GitHub raw link which fetches a Python script (`datagen.py`). * **The Code Execution:** The browser then displays a JSON response. The key \"success\" and its associated value show the script (`datagen.py`) executed successfully with a specific email address (`trial@gmail.com`). This suggests the script probably sent an email or used the email address for some form of authentication or logging. * **The Script:** The `datagen.py` script (from the GitHub URL) is likely a data generation script as implied by its name. The student might be learning how to use such a script for tasks like creating datasets for machine learning projects. * **The Environment:** The `Pretty-print` label suggests a tool is used to format the JSON response for better readability. This is common in programming to improve the appearance of structured data. In short, a student working on a data science project would likely encounter this type of output when using a local development server to execute a script that interacts with external resources (like GitHub) and produces a structured result (JSON) which is then displayed in a browser.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/505", "type": "discourse_post"}
{"id": "discourse_595793_0", "content": "image 1123×760 42.8 KB I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/2/1/213611a3e30fbaa75a62a4a99c19b20458a92609.png [Caption] This Python code defines a function `run_datagen` that automates a data generation process. Let's break down its functionality step-by-step for a student audience: 1. **Input:** The function takes a `task_description` string as input. This string is assumed to contain a URL to a Python script and a user's email address. 2. **Extraction:** It uses regular expressions (`re.search`) to extract the script URL and the user's email from the `task_description`. If either is missing, it returns an error message. The regular expressions are designed to find typical URL and email formats. 3. **Script Download:** It uses the `requests` library to download the Python script from the extracted URL. `response.raise_for_status()` checks if the download was successful (a non-2xx HTTP status code will raise an exception). The downloaded script is saved to a file named \"datagen.py\" in a `PROJECT_ROOT` directory. 4. **UV Dependency Check:** The code then checks if the \"uv\" utility is installed on the system. It attempts to run `uv --version`. If this fails (`FileNotFoundError`), it uses `pip` to install `uv`. `subprocess.DEVNULL` redirects standard output and error streams to prevent them from cluttering the console. 5. **Script Execution:** Finally, it runs the downloaded Python script (\"datagen.py\") using the `subprocess` module. The script is run with the extracted user email as a command-line argument. The `cwd` parameter sets the working directory to `PROJECT_ROOT`. `check=True` ensures that an exception is raised if the script execution fails. 6. **Output:** The function returns a dictionary indicating success or failure. If successful, it includes the executed script URL and the user's email address. **In a student context:** This code demonstrates several important programming concepts: * **Regular expressions:** For data extraction from unstructured text. * **File I/O:** Downloading and writing files. * **Error Handling:** Using `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors (like a failed download or missing utility). * **Subprocesses:** Executing external commands (script and pip). * **Modular Design:** The function encapsulates the entire process, making it reusable. * **Dependency Management:** Checking for and installing necessary utilities. This code would be relevant in a course covering Python programming, scripting, web scraping, or system administration. The use of regular expressions might also be relevant in a course on formal languages or automata theory.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/506", "type": "discourse_post"}

The student is trying to perform two actions: 1. **POST request:** The student sends a POST request to a server endpoint `/run`. This request appears to be querying a SQLite database (`/data/ticket-sales.db`) to calculate the total sales of \"Gold\" type tickets. The request includes the database path and a description of the task. However, the server responds with a `400 Bad Request` error. This indicates a problem with the request itself – the server didn't understand it or found it invalid. 2. **GET request:** After the failed POST request, the student tries to retrieve the results from a file (`/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`) using a GET request to `/read`. This request fails with a `404 Not Found` error, meaning the expected file containing the sales results does not exist at the specified path. This is likely because the POST request failed and didn't create the file. **In summary:** The student's code is attempting to query a database, but there's an issue with the query's formatting or the server's ability to process it. The subsequent attempt to retrieve the result file also fails. This indicates debugging is necessary, possibly focusing on the structure of the POST request or verifying the server's functionality.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/513", "type": "discourse_post"}

{"id": "discourse_595959_0", "content": "Hi everyone, I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the \"data\" key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Codespaces provides cloud-based development environments. The report shows that the user has: * **Used 120 out of 120 allocated core hours.** This means they've fully used their allotted compute time for this billing cycle. The progress bar is completely full. * **Used 1.46 out of 15 GB-months of storage.** They've used a small fraction of their allocated storage space. The progress bar shows only a small portion used. Both usage amounts are within the included quota, so there are no additional charges. The user's quota will reset in 13 days. The cost for both usage items is $0.00.

It displays the current usage of included quotas for core hours and storage. A student using Codespaces can see at a glance: * **Core Hours Used:** 172.37 out of 180.00 included core hours have been used. This represents the amount of time their coding projects have run on the Codespaces cloud computing environment. * **Storage Used:** 9.21 out of 20.00 GB-months of storage have been used. This refers to the amount of space their projects and related files are consuming. * **Billing:** Currently, no charges have been incurred because the student is within their included quotas. The \"$0.00\" shows zero monthly spending. There's an option to set a spending limit to avoid unexpected costs once they exceed their free allocation. * **Quota Reset:** The included quotas will reset in 10 days. This means that usage will start counting from zero after that time. A link to the billing documentation is provided if the student needs further clarification. In short, it's a simple, easy-to-understand summary for a student to monitor their resource consumption and manage their budget within the Codespaces platform.

Codespaces provides cloud-based development environments. The report displays the student's current usage against their included quotas: * **Usage Hours:** The student has used 172.37 out of 180.00 allocated core hours. The progress bar shows this usage visually. * **Storage:** The student has used 9.21 out of 20.00 GB-months of storage. Again, a progress bar visually represents the usage. Both usage metrics are currently within the included quota, and the student is not incurring any extra charges, as indicated by the \"$0.00\" cost for both categories and a total monthly spending of $0.00. The quotas reset in 10 days. There's also an option to set up a spending limit.

{"id": "discourse_596140_0", "content": "image 1919×1016 117 KB this problem occuring sir since two days [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/d/0/d084b074bcf4af69fe3e57753664fd39b016c2ef_2_690x365.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a Python project in a code editor (likely VS Code). The project appears to be a FastAPI application, indicated by the import statements at the top of `main.py`. The code defines a simple API endpoint that returns a message. The terminal shows that the student is encountering problems: * **`pip` version:** The terminal indicates that a newer version of `pip` (the Python package installer) is available and suggests an upgrade command. * **`python` dependency error:** The student attempted to install Python, but an error occurred because no matching distribution was found (possibly due to a typo or incorrect package name). * **`ModuleNotFoundError`:** The most critical error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. This means the `fastapi` library, essential for the project, is not installed in the current Python environment. This is likely the root cause preventing the application from running. * **Docker build:** The student is also attempting to build a Docker image for their application. The build is partially complete. The file explorer shows the project's structure, including Python files (`main.py`, `tasks.py`, etc.), a `Dockerfile`, and a `requirements.txt` file (which likely lists project dependencies). In summary, the image depicts a student debugging a FastAPI application. The main issue is the missing `fastapi` library and potentially a related issue with Python's installation or environment configuration. The student is using Docker for deployment. The screenshot provides a snapshot of their troubleshooting process. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/0/d084b074bcf4af69fe3e57753664fd39b016c2ef.png [Caption] This screenshot shows a student working on a Python project using FastAPI within a Visual Studio Code environment. The student is building a Docker image for their application, which appears to be an LLM-based automation agent. **Key Observations:** * **Code:** The `main.py` file shows a simple FastAPI application setup. The application defines a single endpoint (`/`) that returns a message indicating the agent is running. There is also an attempt to use `run_task` from an `app.tasks` module, suggesting the program handles background tasks. * **Dependencies:** The terminal output shows the student is attempting to install or upgrade the `pip` package manager and also encountered an error related to the `fastapi` library (the `ModuleNotFoundError`). This likely means the `fastapi` library wasn't properly installed in the current environment. * **Docker:** The student is using Docker to containerize their application. The process of building the Docker image is visible in the terminal, showing it's pulling the base python image. * **Errors:** There are multiple error messages indicating that the student is having trouble with package management (`pip install --upgrade python` failed and `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`). The student needs to correctly install the necessary packages for their FastAPI project. * **Project Structure:** The file explorer pane shows a well-structured project with files for database interaction, tasks, utils, tests, and a Dockerfile. This suggests the student is following good software development practices. **In a student context, this image depicts:** * The challenges faced when setting up a Python development environment, especially when using external libraries and Docker. * The process of debugging and troubleshooting errors related to package management and dependency issues. * The practical application of Docker for creating reproducible and portable applications. * Evidence of the student's learning progress in web development (FastAPI) and containerization (Docker). The screenshot captures a common moment in the learning process: encountering and resolving errors. The student's attempts to fix the errors highlight their problem-solving skills and their effort to build a functional application.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/600", "type": "discourse_post"}

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success.

Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment. The report displays the student's current usage against their allocated quota. Specifically: * **Usage Hours:** The student has used 180 out of 180 available core hours. The quota is completely used. * **Storage:** The student has used 9.6 GB out of a 20 GB monthly allowance. They still have storage available. * **Cost:** Currently, both usage hours and storage are within the included quota, resulting in a cost of $0.00 for both. * **Quota Reset:** The included quotas will reset in 8 days. In short, this report shows the student is currently using all their allocated core hours for Codespaces but has some storage space remaining. No charges are incurred as they are operating within their free allowance.

Codespaces provides cloud-based development environments. The student has used 120 out of 120 allocated core hours (processing time) and 1.46 out of 15 GB-months (storage) of their included quota. Both usage amounts are within their free allowance, resulting in a $0.00 cost for both core hours and storage. The quotas reset in 13 days. A link to billing documentation is also available.

The message indicates that the user has reached 100% of their included usage for the current billing cycle. To understand more about their usage and billing, the user is advised to check their billing settings, which is presented as a clickable link. Essentially, it's a notification that the student (or user) has used up their allotted free resources and might need to upgrade their plan or reduce their usage.

Codespaces provides cloud-based development environments. The report indicates that the user has: * **Used 180 out of 180 included core hours:** This means they've fully utilized their allocated computing time for this billing cycle. The progress bar is full (red). * **Used 9.6 out of 20 included GB-months of storage:** They've used nearly half of their allocated storage for this billing cycle. The progress bar shows approximately half full (blue). Both usage amounts are within their included quotas, so there are no additional charges; the cost is shown as $0.00 for both. The quotas will reset in eight days. A link is provided to see the billing documentation for more details. This information is crucial for students using Codespaces to understand their resource consumption and avoid exceeding their free tier limits.

The message states that the user has reached 100% of their allotted usage for the current billing cycle. To learn more, the user is instructed to check their billing settings. This is relevant to students because many educational platforms offer free or discounted access to codespaces with limited usage. Reaching 100% usage means the student may need to upgrade their plan or adjust their coding habits to avoid exceeding their free allowance.

The request is trying to send data using the `task` parameter, pointing to a file `/data/dates.txt`. However, the server returned a `200 OK` status code along with an error message. The error message in the JSON response indicates that the value sent for the `response_format.type` parameter is invalid. The server only accepts 'json_object', 'json_schema', or 'text', and the student likely sent 'json', which caused the error. This suggests a misunderstanding of the expected data format by the student. The response also includes other data like `monthlyCost` and `cost`. The overall situation suggests a debugging exercise in a software development or web services course.

They're making a POST request to a server at `http://localhost:8000/run`. The request includes a parameter `task` which appears to specify a file path (`/data/dates.txt`). The server responded with a `200 OK` status code, indicating success, but the response body contains an error message. The error message indicates that the value sent for a parameter (likely within the `task` parameter or elsewhere in the request body) is invalid. The server expects one of three values: `json_object`, `json_schema`, or `text`. The student sent `json`, which is not one of the accepted formats. Despite the error, some other data was returned, such as `monthlyCost`, `cost`, and `monthlyRequ`. This suggests the server processed parts of the request successfully despite the invalid format of the parameter. The student will need to correct the request's format to fix this error.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/638", "type": "discourse_post"}

Both rows indicate that the file type is an \"IMAGE\". * **Visibility:** This column shows the accessibility of each image file. Both images have a \"Public\" visibility setting, meaning they are viewable by anyone. The red circle highlights the \"Public\" status of the more recently uploaded image, emphasizing its public accessibility. In a student context, this could represent a file management system used for school projects or assignments where students upload their work. The \"Public\" visibility setting might be relevant if the assignment requires sharing work publicly, or if the student mistakenly made their work public.

The commit history indicates recent activity, with commits focusing on implementing an API for an automation agent and adding the Dockerfile. The project's description on GitHub is currently empty. The screenshot also shows that a screenshot of the project has been taken using a tool within GitHub. In short, the image provides a snapshot of a student's software development project hosted on GitHub, showcasing the code structure, progress, and basic project metadata. The use of Python and Docker suggests a project that might involve data science, machine learning, or other tasks requiring a containerized environment.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/658", "type": "discourse_post"}

Let's break it down step by step: 1. **`cd hello_world`:** The student navigates to a directory named \"hello_world\" using the `cd` command. 2. **`$^[[200~1s -1 Dockerfile`:** This line is an attempt to list files (using `ls`), but it's incorrectly formatted. The `$^[[200~` is not a standard shell command; it's likely a leftover artifact from a terminal editor or other program. The `-1` option would have attempted to list files one per line. 3. **`bash: $'\\E[200~1s': command not found`:** The shell reports an error because it doesn't recognize the command. This reinforces the fact that the student made a mistake in the previous line. 4. **`ls -1 Dockerfile`:** The student correctly uses the `ls -1` command to list the files in the current directory. The `-1` option ensures each filename is displayed on a new line. The output shows a file named \"Dockerfile\" with permissions, owner (\"hsent\"), size, and last modified date/time. 5. **`-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile`:** This is the output from the successful `ls -1 Dockerfile` command. It provides details about the Dockerfile. 6. **`AC`:** The final line shows the student typed \"AC\" and pressed enter. This is likely an incomplete or incorrect command, as it doesn't have a clear purpose within the context of the preceding actions. **In summary:** The image demonstrates the student's learning process, showing both correct and incorrect uses of the command line to interact with their \"hello_world\" project's Dockerfile. The error in the second line highlights the importance of accurate command syntax in the terminal.

The folder is located within a user's directory (\"hsent\" in this case). The window is set to \"Details\" view, showing the file name, date modified, type, and size of each file and folder within \"hello_world\". The files and folders include: * **app:** A Python source file. * **Dockerfile:** A file likely used for creating Docker containers. * **LICENSE:** A license file. * **README:** A Markdown file, likely containing instructions or information about the project. * **requirements:** A text document, probably listing project dependencies. * **git:** A folder, likely containing version control information. This is typical of the file structure a student might have for a simple programming project. The small file sizes suggest a small-scale project. The presence of a README and requirements file indicates a level of organization and documentation that's good practice in software development.

It's a simple project, as evidenced by the few files listed: * **app.py:** This is likely the main program file, presumably containing a basic \"Hello, world!\" program. * **LICENSE:** A file containing the project's license (in this case, MIT). This specifies how the code can be used and distributed. * **README.md:** A file describing the project. This usually contains information about the project's purpose, how to use it, and any relevant details. The repository contains four commits, all made within the last two months. The \"main\" branch is shown, along with two other branches. The interface shows typical GitHub features such as the ability to add files, view code, and manage the project's settings. The interface style suggests the use of a dark theme. Overall, the image depicts a very basic, newly created or recently updated project on GitHub.

The project requires several pre-requisites to be met before the submission itself is even evaluated. These prerequisites include: * **GitHub Repository:** The student's GitHub repository must exist, be publicly accessible, contain a valid `Dockerfile`, and include an MIT license file. * **Docker Image:** The student must have a Docker image that's publicly accessible and runs correctly using a specific command. This image must use the same `Dockerfile` as in their GitHub repository. The email shows the results of an automated check of these prerequisites. The student's Docker image is publicly accessible, but they failed to meet the other requirements: their GitHub repository is not public, it lacks a `Dockerfile`, and it's missing the MIT license. Because the student failed to meet these minimum requirements, their Project 1 submission will not be evaluated. Their overall score for Project 1 is 0.

The student has failed to meet the minimum requirements, resulting in a score of 0 and the project not being evaluated. The message details five prerequisites: 1. A publicly accessible GitHub repository. 2. A LICENSE file with the MIT license in the GitHub repository. 3. A valid Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. 4. A publicly accessible Docker image that runs correctly using a specified command (`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`). 5. The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The automated evaluation shows that only the Docker image's presence in DockerHub was successful (PASS). The rest of the prerequisites failed (FAIL). Because the student failed to meet the minimum requirements, their Project 1 submission will not be graded. The student needs to address these failures before resubmitting.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/661", "type": "discourse_post"}

The URLs are either DockerHub image references (like `dog/diya`) or GitHub repository links (`https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1`). * **result:** This column indicates whether the check passed (\"OK\") or failed (\"FAIL\"). * **type:** This column specifies the type of check being performed (Docker, Repo, License, Dockerfile, Clone). These refer to different aspects of a software project, focusing on aspects like containerization, code repository existence, licensing, build files and source code retrieval. * **message:** This column provides a more detailed explanation of the result. For example, a \"FAIL\" for a Docker check might mean the Docker image is not publicly available. **In a student context:** This table likely shows the results of automated checks run as part of a student's software project submission. The checks verify different aspects of the project, such as the availability of necessary code and resources. A \"FAIL\" on any of these checks could indicate a problem that needs to be fixed before the project can be accepted. The email address identifies the student; the GitHub URL points to their project repository. This system ensures that the submitted project meets certain criteria and has all the components required.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-tds-score-not-showing-i/168916/15", "type": "discourse_post"}

The man is screaming, covered in blood, and appears terrified. Godzilla's gaping maw is positioned directly over him. The text overlay reads, \"Tools in Data Science.\" This image uses a striking visual metaphor to represent the overwhelming and potentially daunting nature of learning and mastering the various tools used in data science. Godzilla, a symbol of immense power and destructive force, symbolizes the complexity and sheer number of tools a data scientist must learn to use effectively. The man represents the data scientist struggling to manage and understand this vast landscape of tools.

A large, monstrous creature (resembling Godzilla) is depicted in the act of attacking a terrified man. The text \"Tools in Data Science\" is overlaid, suggesting that the creature represents the overwhelming and potentially destructive nature of the many complex tools and technologies involved in data science. The man, covered in blood, symbolizes a student or professional struggling to master these tools. The visual is meant to be provocative and memorable, emphasizing the steep learning curve and potential frustrations inherent in the field. The image is not meant to be literally interpreted, but rather serves as an analogy to illustrate the intensity and difficulty that can be associated with data science tool acquisition and application.

It features a man, sharply dressed in a black suit and shirt, leaning against a black luxury SUV. He's wearing sunglasses and holding a cigar, suggesting a character with wealth, power, or a criminal element. His styled hair and beard contribute to a sophisticated yet potentially menacing appearance. The grayscale background emphasizes the subject and his attire, creating a dramatic effect. The overall visual style is sleek and cinematic, designed to attract attention and create intrigue about the film's plot and characters. The image could be analyzed in a film studies class to discuss character portrayal, visual storytelling techniques, or genre conventions.

It features a man, centrally positioned, who appears to be the main character. He's dressed in a dark, sharp-looking suit, suggesting a sophisticated or powerful persona. He's wearing sunglasses and has a groomed beard and hairstyle, further contributing to his polished, possibly villainous, image. He's holding a cigar, adding to the impression of wealth, power, and possibly danger. He's leaning against a luxury vehicle, which underscores the theme of affluence and status. The overall aesthetic is dark and moody, emphasizing a serious and intense tone. The image is carefully composed, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the man, drawing the viewer's eye directly to him.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-tds-score-not-showing-i/168916/20", "type": "discourse_post"}

The surface has a grid-like pattern faintly visible and emits a soft, bluish light. The hands are closely positioned, suggesting a collaborative or simultaneous input process. The lighting and focus are soft, making it difficult to see precise details, but it creates a sense of mystery around the technology being used. The scene could be interpreted as representing: * **Collaborative work:** Multiple individuals are working together on a shared digital project. * **Technological innovation:** The technology depicted is advanced and potentially futuristic. * **Problem-solving:** The hands could be working together to solve a complex problem presented on the illuminated surface. * **Data input:** The process may involve the simultaneous input of large amounts of data. The overall context suggests an advanced technological setting, likely in a science fiction or futuristic context, where multiple individuals are actively engaged in a high-tech task. The ambiguity of the image allows for several interpretations depending on the subject of discussion.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-jan-25-imp-announcement-for-project-2/170413/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.

The tiger's mouth is open in a snarl, revealing its teeth and showcasing its powerful canines. Its eyes are intense and focused, giving a sense of aggression or threat. The background is dark and blurry, drawing all attention to the tiger itself. From a student's perspective, this image could be used for various educational purposes: * **Science:** Studying animal anatomy (teeth, fur, muscles implied by posture), predator/prey relationships, endangered species (Sumatran tigers are critically endangered), and animal behavior (aggression, defense). * **Art:** Analyzing the composition, lighting, and the use of contrast to create a dramatic effect. The image could inspire artwork focusing on wildlife or portraying emotion. * **English/Language Arts:** Using the image as a prompt for creative writing, focusing on imagery, figurative language, or a narrative about the tiger's situation. The image's powerful and intense nature makes it memorable and engaging for learning. It can be used to explore a variety of topics across the curriculum.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-various-issues-graded-assignments-project-doubts-and-roe-score-updates/170147/2", "type": "discourse_post"}
{"id": "discourse_607520_0", "content": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.

It's a humorous take on the long hours students spend working on their laptops. * **Distraction:** The cat itself could be the distraction from studies, a cute and furry interruption. Students often relate to the challenges of maintaining focus when pets are around. * **Online learning:** The image could represent the growing prevalence of online learning and the sometimes unexpected \"co-workers\" students might have while studying at home.

The left side displays the exam questions, which appear to focus on programming and API interaction. Specifically, one question (question 1) requires the student to build a FastAPI proxy server that adds a CORS header to responses. The student has entered a URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) as their answer, but an error message indicates an \"Incorrect response\". The right side of the image shows the student's use of a tool, likely Postman or a similar API testing client, to test their solution. The tool shows multiple requests made to various endpoints, including their own, suggesting they are testing and debugging their code. The terminal window at the bottom displays various HTTP responses, further indicating debugging activities. The presence of the terminal output along with the successful and unsuccessful API requests suggest they are troubleshooting and attempting to resolve the \"Incorrect response\" error reported in their exam interface. The overall context suggests the student is working on a practical programming exam, using both an API testing client and likely a local development environment to create and test the required API proxy server. The remaining exam questions hint towards data science or algorithm implementation problems.

The left side displays the exam questions, which include tasks involving large language models (LLMs), geographic calculations, and correlation analysis. The main focus is a programming question requiring the student to create a FastAPI proxy server that handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. The student must provide the URL of their functioning proxy server. The right side shows the student using a tool like Thunder Client (a popular HTTP client) to test their solution. The Thunder Client interface displays the student's requests to their proxy server and the responses received, including successful and unsuccessful attempts, HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 422 Unprocessable Entity), and response data. The terminal shows further debug information. The successful response shows the data was fetched correctly from the intended source, but with the addition of the CORS header added by the student's proxy server, indicating a successful implementation. The various HTTP requests and responses show that the student is iteratively testing and debugging their code.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/168832/53", "type": "discourse_post"}

A student might see this in a data analysis or programming class. **Here's a breakdown for a student:** * **Top Section (Requirement already satisfied...):** This shows the Python packages (libraries) used in the code. It confirms that all necessary packages (like `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`) were successfully installed and are ready to use. The paths show where these are located on the system. This is important because without these packages, the code wouldn't run. * **Middle Section (q-extract-tables-from-pdf...):** This section shows the execution of a Python script. The script is likely using the `tabula-py` library to extract tabular data (tables) from a PDF file named \"q-extract-ta...m-pdf (2).pdf\". The \"100% done\" indicates successful extraction. The warnings about fallback fonts are usually not critical; they simply mean the script used substitute fonts because the original fonts from the PDF weren't available. * **Bottom Section (Maths Physics English...):** This is the result of the data extraction. It displays a table of numerical data, likely grades or scores in different subjects (Maths, Physics, English, Economics, Biology) for different groups (represented by the numbers 0-4). The `int64` indicates that the data is stored as 64-bit integers. `dtype: object` is a note on the data type of the whole table, and `34919` might be some kind of file size or other metadata. **In a student's context, this image could represent:** * **A successful data extraction task:** The student successfully used a Python script to get data from a PDF file. * **Data analysis workflow:** The image shows part of a larger project where the student extracts and then likely will analyze data. * **Understanding of Python libraries:** The student demonstrates familiarity with data manipulation libraries like `pandas` and `tabula-py`. * **Debugging:** The warning messages show how to identify and potentially address minor issues (font problems) encountered while running the script. In short, this is a snapshot of a student's work involving data extraction, potentially part of a larger data analysis or programming assignment.

The question asks the student to calculate the total Biology marks achieved by students who scored 30 or more in a Maths test. The data comes from two groups of students (groups 1-28). The student has entered an answer (34919), which has been marked incorrect. The question implies that there's a data set (not shown) containing Maths and Biology scores for the students, and the student must filter the data to find the required sum. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/b/7b2ceabebead81102cadc823edd2707035627364_2_690x291.png [Caption] This image shows a terminal session where a student is using Python and the `tabula-py` library to extract data from a PDF file named \"q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf\". The top section displays successful installation or confirmation of various Python packages required for this task, including `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and others. This indicates that the necessary software dependencies are correctly installed and available to the student's Python environment. The middle section shows the progress of the PDF data extraction. It indicates the file size and that the process completed successfully (100% done). There are also some warnings related to fallback fonts used by the `tabula-py` library during PDF processing; these warnings are not critical errors and likely related to font handling in the PDF document. The bottom section presents the extracted data as a Pandas DataFrame, a common data structure in Python for tabular data. This is displayed in a tabular format with columns for \"Maths,\" \"Physics,\" \"English,\" \"Economics,\" \"Biology,\" and \"Group,\" along with rows of numerical data. The final lines show the data type of each column (\"int64\" for the numerical columns and \"object\" for the \"Group\" column) and a likely row count (34919). In summary, the image documents a student's successful use of Python for data extraction from a PDF, highlighting the steps involved (package installations, data extraction, and data display). The warnings suggest that the PDF might have some formatting quirks, but the overall data extraction was successful.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/168832/62", "type": "discourse_post"}

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form.

The meaning of these numbers isn't clear from the image alone; it could represent a number of attempts, files, or some other metric.

Key features include: * **Open-book and collaborative nature:** The instructions explicitly state that students can use any resources, including the internet, AI tools (like ChatGPT), and even attempt to \"hack\" the code. This suggests a focus on problem-solving and resourcefulness rather than rote memorization. * **Frequent saving:** Students are encouraged to save their progress regularly using the provided \"Save\" button. Their last saved submission is the one that will be graded. * **Real-time feedback:** A \"Check\" button allows students to check their answers multiple times without penalty. * **Bonus opportunity:** A bonus mark is available if students complete a separate form by a deadline. * **Technical support:** Links to a Discourse forum (for questions) and Google Meet (for technical issues) are provided, exclusively for IITM students. * **Current progress:** The student's current score is shown as \"0\", and their recent saved scores (8 on two occasions) are displayed, indicating that they have already attempted the quiz.

Let's break down the columns: * **tds-2025-01-ga1:** This appears to be a session ID or a code identifying a particular group or event, perhaps related to a specific academic term (2025-01) and a group (\"ga1\"). * **22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in:** This is an email address, likely belonging to a student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). The \"ds\" might stand for \"Department of Studies\" or a similar designation. * **2025-01-27 00:00:23 / 2025-01-26 23:59:01:** These are timestamps indicating the date and time of activity. They represent the time of login attempts or other recorded actions. * **7.75 / 7:** This column likely represents a numerical value; potentially a score, a duration of activity, or another quantitative metric related to student performance or engagement. * **10:** This column could be a maximum score, a weight, or another reference value associated with the numerical data in the previous column. In summary, the table appears to log student activity (possibly logins) associated with a specific group or course at IITM, recording the time of activity and some sort of numerical data point, perhaps related to a grade or task completion. The data's exact meaning needs additional context. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/6/768e2898d68adebf9930e22fc481a16504196945_2_690x94.png [Caption] This image shows a table with four rows of data. Each row appears to represent a record, possibly from a database or log file. The columns likely represent: * **Identifier:** `tds-2025-01-ga1` (This seems to be a unique identifier for each record, possibly indicating a timestamp or project code). There's a slight variation in the last character in the last row (\"l\" instead of \"1\"). * **Email Address:** `22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (This is consistent across all rows and suggests a student or researcher email address from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM)). * **Timestamp:** Dates and times indicating when the record was created or updated. There are two distinct timestamps, 2025-01-27 00:00:23 and 2025-01-26 23:59:01. * **Value 1:** Numerical values (7.75 and 7) that might represent grades, scores, or other quantitative data. * **Value 2:** The number 10 is constant across all rows and might represent a maximum possible value, a weight, or a category. In a student context, this could represent: * **Gradebook Data:** The table could be a snapshot of student grades or scores for a specific assignment, with the email identifying the student. * **Experiment Log:** The data might record the results of an experiment conducted by students, with the timestamps indicating when the data points were recorded. * **Project Submission Records:** It might represent timestamps and submission details related to student projects. The slight discrepancy in the identifier in the last row suggests a possible data entry error. Further context (e.g., the name of the table, the application it's from, a header row with column names) would clarify its meaning more completely.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignments-dashboard-scores-incorrect-missing/166816/51", "type": "discourse_post"}

The instructions below the error message explain that the program will check if the API response to a GET request matches the expected output. It emphasizes that any arguments sent to the API must match the order defined in the API function. The student needs to debug their code and URL to resolve the \"Failed to fetch\" error to proceed.

The top part gives an example API URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student has tried this URL, adding a query parameter `?q=` (which would contain the task to be executed). However, they received a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, indicating that the API request failed. The explanation below suggests the student should try sending a GET request to the same URL with the `?q=` parameter containing a task. The system will then check the response against what it expects, making sure the arguments in the request match the order specified in the function definition of the API. The error suggests a problem with either the URL, the request format, or the server-side implementation of the API.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/116", "type": "discourse_post"}

The exam involves making an API call to a specified URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`) using a GET request. The student has entered this URL, but received a \"Bad Request\" error. The instructions indicate that the student needs to include a query parameter (`?q=...`) containing a task, and the request must conform to a given JSON structure for arguments. The final question involves using a Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve a specific output. The student's current score is 6.5 out of 9.5, suggesting they are nearing completion but have some issues with the API request. The deadline is clearly visible at the top. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/2/a2d87d7048eea2c5fb6527a5809ac1933296831b_2_690x431.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's Python code in a development environment (likely VS Code or a similar IDE). The code is designed to parse user queries, specifically looking for patterns related to scheduling meetings and viewing expense balances. The left panel displays the project's file structure, including the `main.py` file where the core logic resides. The central panel shows the Python code. The code uses regular expressions (`re.match()`) to identify keywords and extract relevant information from the user's input. For example, it attempts to match queries like \"Arrange meeting [date], [time], room: [room]\" and \"Show my expense balance for employee [employee ID]\". The bottom panel shows the output from the program's execution. There are several error messages indicating \"400 Bad Request\" and \"404 Not Found,\" which are HTTP status codes signifying problems with the queries sent to a server (possibly a web service or API). This suggests the student's code is interacting with an external system. The parsing logic appears to be successful, but the interaction with the server side needs debugging. The `parse_query` function handles initial parsing, and then there is a conditional branching structure to address the different query types. The terminal also shows the Python version and environment. In short, the screenshot captures a student working on a Python project that involves parsing natural language queries, using regular expressions, and potentially interacting with a server-side application, currently encountering HTTP errors that require further investigation. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/2/a2d87d7048eea2c5fb6527a5809ac1933296831b.jpeg [Caption] This image shows a student's Python code within a code editor (likely VS Code or a similar IDE). The code defines a function `parse_query` which uses regular expressions (`re.match`) to interpret natural language queries. It appears to be designed to handle two types of queries: 1. **Scheduling a meeting:** The regex attempts to extract the date, time, and room from queries like \"Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1\". 2. **Showing expense balance:** The regex aims to extract the employee ID from queries like \"Show my expense balance for employee \". The code then returns a structured dictionary containing the extracted information. The lower portion of the image displays the output console. It shows several `400 Bad Request` errors and a `404 Not Found` error from HTTP requests. This indicates that the queries the code is trying to send are failing, likely due to issues with the query formatting or the server's response. The student is likely debugging these errors to ensure their query parsing and HTTP requests are working correctly. The `DEBUG CONSOLE` and `TERMINAL` tabs suggest the student is using debugging tools within the IDE to trace the flow of execution and identify where the problems occur. The presence of a `requirements.txt` file in the project explorer indicates that the student is likely using external libraries (packages). [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/5/a5199d9f6c6e3733ee20568d5c787a40cad041f8.png [Caption] This image shows a student's screen during an online exam. The exam is testing their understanding of API calls and potentially server-side functions. Specifically: * **The Task:** The student is asked to provide a valid API URL endpoint. The system has given a sample endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`) as a hint. They've entered this URL, but received a \"Bad Request\" error. * **The Code:** A JSON snippet shows the expected structure for a function call, including a `name` and `arguments` field. This likely represents how data should be sent in the GET request. The student needs to understand how to incorporate this JSON structure correctly into the API call. * **CORS:** The instructions highlight the need for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from the student's browser (origin) to the server. * **Debugging:** The student is receiving a \"Bad Request\" error, indicating that their API call is not properly formatted or the server is not responding correctly to the request. The system mentions a subsequent check that involves sending a GET request to the URL with additional parameters to verify a correct response and argument order. * **Final Task:** There's an additional (apparently unrelated) task to get a Large Language Model (LLM) to output \"Yes\", indicating the exam might involve interactions with external AI tools. In summary, the image depicts a coding problem that requires a student to construct and debug an API call, understand CORS, and potentially utilise an LLM. The error message suggests the student needs to refine their API request, potentially concerning the formatting of the JSON data or other issues on the server-side.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga3-large-language-models-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/163247/127", "type": "discourse_post"}

The project requires the student to meet several conditions, including: * **GitHub Repository:** The student's GitHub repository must exist, be publicly accessible, contain a valid `Dockerfile`, and include a MIT license file. * **Docker Image:** A Docker image associated with the project must be publicly accessible on Docker Hub and use the same `Dockerfile` as the one in the GitHub repository. The image must also run successfully using a provided `podman` command. The evaluation results show that the student's Docker image was not publicly accessible on Docker Hub, despite the other prerequisites being met.

The project requires the student to meet several criteria related to their GitHub repository and Docker image, including: * **GitHub Repository:** The repository must exist, be publicly accessible, contain a valid `Dockerfile`, and include a LICENSE file with the MIT license. * **Docker Image:** The Docker image must be publicly accessible on Docker Hub, runnable via a provided command, and must use the same `Dockerfile` as the GitHub repository. The email then shows the results of automated checks against these requirements. While the student's GitHub repository meets most criteria (public, contains `Dockerfile`, and MIT license), their Docker image failed the check for being public on Docker Hub. Because of this failure to meet the minimum requirements, the student's Project 1 submission will not be evaluated and their score is 0. The student needs to address the Docker image issue before resubmitting.

The system checks several prerequisites: * **Docker Image:** The system failed to find a public Docker image in Docker Hub. This is a critical failure, indicated by \"FAIL\". This is highlighted in red. * **GitHub Repository:** The system found a public GitHub repository (\"PASS\"). * **Dockerfile:** A `Dockerfile` was found in the root of the GitHub repository (\"PASS\"). * **MIT License:** An MIT license was found in the root of the GitHub repository (\"PASS\"). Because the Docker image prerequisite failed, the overall \"Prerequisites\" check also failed (\"FAIL\"), resulting in a project score of 0. The student needs to address the missing or private Docker image to pass the project. The random characters on the right are irrelevant to the grading results.

The table has three columns: \"Last Pushed\", \"Contains\", and \"Visibility\". * **Last Pushed:** This column indicates when the files were last uploaded or updated. One file was last pushed about two hours ago, and the other was last pushed two months ago. * **Contains:** This column specifies the type of content. Both rows indicate that the file type is an \"IMAGE\". * **Visibility:** This column shows the accessibility of each image file. Both images have a \"Public\" visibility setting, meaning they are viewable by anyone. The red circle highlights the \"Public\" status of the more recently uploaded image, emphasizing its public accessibility. In a student context, this could represent a file management system used for school projects or assignments where students upload their work. The \"Public\" visibility setting might be relevant if the assignment requires sharing work publicly, or if the student mistakenly made their work public. The \"Last Pushed\" column indicates the recency of the file uploads, potentially useful for tracking progress.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/173", "type": "discourse_post"}

The repository is public, meaning its code is visible to anyone. The project appears to be a Python project, as evidenced by the `.py` files (datagen.py, evaluate.py, main.py), a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies, and a `Dockerfile` for containerization. A `LICENSE` and `README.md` file are also present, indicating good software development practices. The commit history shows recent activity, suggesting the project is under active development. The student, Mayank8IITM, has made several commits over the past two months, primarily focused on creating the project structure and Dockerizing it. The project's progress seems to be tracked in the commit messages (\"Project is done 7/10\"). [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/e/4/e4a17e2340281059ba12ec777f0a33a1c662f3ea_2_690x172.png [Caption] This image shows the results of a project submission's prerequisite check. A student submitted Project 1, and the system evaluated several criteria. * **Docker Image:** The student successfully uploaded a Docker image to Dockerhub, and it was publicly accessible (PASS). * **GitHub Repository:** The student failed to create a public GitHub repository (FAIL). This is a critical failure. * **Dockerfile:** The student failed to include a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of their GitHub repository (FAIL). This is also a critical failure. * **MIT License:** The student failed to include an MIT license file in the root directory of their GitHub repository (FAIL). This is a less critical failure but contributes to the overall result. Because of these failures, the prerequisites are marked as \"FAIL,\" and the student received a score of 0 for Project 1. The system likely won't grade the project until these issues are addressed. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/b/1baedfbbb7140eb2f3bc80273f8dcfa799bb85e3_2_690x486.png [Caption] This image shows a GitHub repository for a project named \"tds-trail-1,\" owned by a user named Mayank8IITM. The repository is public (indicated by the red circle around \"Public\"). The left panel displays the file structure of the project, showing key files like `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`. These files are common in software development projects; the `Dockerfile` is used for containerization, `LICENSE` specifies the software license, and `README.md` contains project documentation. Other files suggest Python code (`datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `main.py`, `requirements.txt`). The right panel shows a commit history of the project over the last two months, indicating various actions like creating files, updating the `Dockerfile`, and marking project milestones (\"Project is done 7/10\"). In short, the image provides a snapshot of a student's (or anyone's) software project hosted on GitHub, showcasing its structure and development history.

The system checked four prerequisites: 1. **Docker Image:** The student's Docker image was successfully found on Docker Hub and was public (PASS). 2. **GitHub Repo:** The student had a GitHub repository, but it was not public (FAIL). 3. **Dockerfile:** The `Dockerfile` was missing from the root directory of the GitHub repository (FAIL). 4. **MIT License:** An MIT license was also missing from the root directory of the GitHub repository (FAIL). Because three out of four prerequisites failed, the overall prerequisites evaluation is FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The student needs to make the necessary corrections (making their GitHub repo public, adding a `Dockerfile`, and including an MIT license) to have their project evaluated.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/175", "type": "discourse_post"}

The main focus is a `Dockerfile` which automates the creation of a Docker image. The `Dockerfile` outlines several steps: 1. **Base Image:** It starts with a slim version of Python 3.12 as the base image. 2. **System Dependencies:** It installs system dependencies necessary for scientific computing libraries (like SciPy) using `apt-get`. 3. **UV Installation:** It installs `uv`, likely a performance-enhancing library. 4. **Python Package Installation:** It installs various Python packages using `pip`, including `fastapi` (a web framework), `uvicorn` (an ASGI server), and several data science libraries. 5. **Environment Variable:** It sets the `PATH` environment variable to include the location of the installed binaries. 6. **Application Directory Setup:** It sets up the application directory within the Docker container. 7. **Copying Application Files:** It copies the application files (presumably Python code) into the container. 8. **Port Exposure:** It exposes port 8000, the port the application will run on. 9. **Starting the Server:** Finally, it starts a `uvicorn` server to run the `fastapi` application. The handwritten \"mine\" next to the code suggests the student is claiming ownership of this particular code. The left-hand pane shows the file structure of the project, including Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, etc.) indicating this is likely a data science or machine learning project involving data generation, evaluation, and possibly model training/deployment within a docker container. The overall context suggests a student working on a project involving containerization and Python for a course, possibly relating to data science or web development. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/8/78eaf46821c5af8d1f6844561dc235a1e22f6de7_2_690x377.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work in a GitHub repository. The main focus is a `Dockerfile` which outlines the steps to build a Docker image for a Python application. Specifically: * **File Structure:** The left-hand panel displays the project's file structure, including Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, etc.), a `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`. This suggests a structured project. * **Dockerfile Content:** The central portion shows the `Dockerfile` itself. This file details the process of creating a Docker image: * It starts with a base Python 3.12 slim image. * It installs system dependencies (using `apt-get`) for libraries like SciPy. * It installs necessary Python packages using `pip`. * It sets the environment variable `PATH` to include the location of the installed application. * It copies application files into the image. * It exposes port 8000. * Finally, it starts the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`. * **Student Annotation:** There's a handwritten annotation \"5 & lend\" at the top right, which is likely a personal note unrelated to the code itself, possibly a reminder or a thought. In summary, the image depicts a student working on a Python project using Docker for deployment. The `Dockerfile` demonstrates understanding of Docker's functionalities and the process of packaging a Python application for containerization. The annotation is an extraneous detail. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/3/0/300e62ae1bb91e990020843f9db4aab25bd9ac70.png [Caption] This image shows a student's work on a Dockerfile for a Python project (TDS_Project_1). The main file is `app.py`, and other supporting files are also present (e.g., `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`). The Dockerfile itself uses a slim version of Python 3.12 as its base image. It then installs system dependencies (using `apt-get`), installs necessary Python packages (`pip`), sets the application directory, copies application files into the container, exposes port 8000, and finally starts a FastAPI server using `uvicorn`. The handwritten annotation \"mine\" suggests the student considers this their own work. The file structure and Dockerfile content are consistent with a typical software engineering project in a university setting, potentially involving data generation, evaluation, and web service deployment. [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/8/78eaf46821c5af8d1f6844561dc235a1e22f6de7.png [Caption] This image shows a student's code repository in a Git-based platform (likely GitHub or GitLab). The main focus is a `Dockerfile` which automates the creation of a Docker image for a Python application. Specifically, the `Dockerfile`: * **Uses a slim Python 3.12 Bookworm image as a base:** This keeps the image size small and uses a specific Python version. * **Installs system dependencies:** It uses `apt-get` to install necessary libraries (like SciPy, which often requires a lot of dependencies), essential build tools, and other utilities. * **Installs `uv`:** This is likely a high-performance asynchronous I/O library. * **Installs Python packages:** Uses `pip` to install the Python packages required for the application. These include `fastapi` (a web framework), `uvicorn` (an ASGI server), and several data science related packages like `scipy`, `pandas`, and `requests`. * **Sets the application directory:** The application's files are copied into the `/app` directory inside the container. * **Exposes port 8000:** This makes the application accessible from the outside world. * **Starts the `uvicorn` server:** This command starts the application server, specifying the host and port. The file structure on the left shows related files like a `.env` file (for environment variables), `app.py` (the main application file), and likely other supporting files. The handwritten note \"5 & lend\" is unrelated to the code and seems to be a random scribble. The presence of a `.env` file suggests that the application may utilize environment variables for configuration. The usage of a Dockerfile and Python's `fastapi` framework indicates a web application project likely aimed at a backend or API context. In summary, this image displays a typical student project setup, leveraging containerization and several libraries to build and deploy a Python application. The overall context suggests coursework involving Docker, Python, and potentially data science or web development.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/430", "type": "discourse_post"}

So should we just use gpt-4o-mini or use the OpenAI API for gpt3.5 turbo? @carlton [Image] https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/b/8/b86f7ddaff9b11e54f240e51d39ac9f51cb03e25.png [Caption] This is a multiple choice question testing understanding of the cost of using a large language model (LLM). The student is given a short Japanese sentence as input text to the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model. They are asked to calculate the cost of *only* the input in cents. The key information is that the cost per one million input tokens is 50 cents. The student needs to determine how many input tokens are in the Japanese sentence (this would require an external tool or prior knowledge to count) and then use that number to calculate the cost based on the provided rate. The four options represent different possible costs in cents. The correct answer would depend on the actual number of input tokens in the Japanese sentence.

The student is given a short Japanese sentence as input to the \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\" model. They are told that the cost of processing this input is 50 cents per million tokens. The question asks the student to calculate the cost in cents of processing the given Japanese sentence, choosing from four options representing different costs. The student needs to determine the number of tokens in the Japanese sentence (though this information isn't explicitly provided) and apply the given pricing to determine the final cost. In essence, it combines language model usage with a simple cost calculation problem.", "source": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/1", "type": "discourse_post"}

Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building. The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.

{"id": "embeddings_embeddings-openai-and-local-models_0", "content": "## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: 1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature     | Local Models               | API                       | | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | | **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     |", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/embeddings?id=embeddings-openai-and-local-models", "type": "course_content"}

Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input. 5.

Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.

This impacts image size a lot - **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data - **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files - **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss - **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. - Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one) - Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as lossy WebP Common operations with Python: ```python from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/image-compression?id=images-compression", "type": "course_content"}

LLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: 1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**.

You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute). **Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?** **A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser. **Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?** **A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript.

Do we need JavaScript to extract information?** **A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs). **Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?** **A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. **Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?** **A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable.

Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work. **Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?** **A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#). **Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?** **A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array. **Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard. **Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?** **A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option. **Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?** **A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab.

A random participant is selected to answer a question. **Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?** **A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`. **Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?** **A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears. **Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?** **A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects.

Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient. **Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?** **A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question. **Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?** **A4:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles.", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-17?id=live-session-17-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response. **Q8: What is Postman and how does it work?** **A8:** Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose. **Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?** **A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (`>`) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail. **Q10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-17?id=live-session-17-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation. **Q11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?** **A11:** When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the `encoding` parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding. **Q12: How to use Git and GitHub?** **A12:** The instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation. **Q13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-17?id=live-session-17-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

The responses are used to plan future sessions. **Q16: What is GitHub, and how is it used in the project?** **A16:** GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. In the project, you will push your code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible to others and enabling collaboration. **Q17: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?** **A17:** Git is a version control system that you install and use on your local machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for remote collaboration and code sharing. **Q18: What are the alternatives to using command-line tools for Git and GitHub operations?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-20?id=live-session-20-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools. **Q19: How does the `sed` editor work for replacing text in files?** **A19:** The `sed` editor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the `s` command for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching. **Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-20?id=live-session-20-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching. **Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?** **A21:** The `find` command can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the `-exec` option to execute a command, like `sed`, on each file found. For example, `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;` will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace \"IITM\" with \"IIT Madras\" (case-insensitive) in each file. **Q22: Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error when pushing to GitHub?** **A22:** This could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication. **Q23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?** **A23:** You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password.", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-20?id=live-session-20-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today. **Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?** **A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time. **Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?** **A5:** You can do it without a premium version.

But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?** **A9:** Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box. **Q10: What is CI/CD?** **A10:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it.

You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo. **Q12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?** **A12:** Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos. **Q13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?** **A13:** Yes, that's possible. **Q14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?** **A14:** There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week.

The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task. **Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?** **A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab. **Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?** **A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found.

The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames. **Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?** **A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data.

Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv <env_name>`. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub.

This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify. **Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?** **A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project.

We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session. **Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?** **A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later. **Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?** **A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools. **Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-28?id=live-session-28-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools. **Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?** **A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM. **Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?** **A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file. **Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline.

The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section. **Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?** **A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it. **Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?** **A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it.

Is there support available?** **A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done. **Q10: What's required for grading?** **A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria: - It must exist and be publicly accessible. - It must have a license file (MIT license). - It must have a valid Dockerfile. - The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command. - The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit.

You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12. **Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?** **A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code. **Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?** **A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code. **Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-28?id=live-session-28-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?** **A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API. **Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs.

Do I have to pay?** **A26:** No, you don't have to pay. **Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?** **A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due. **Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend.

API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs. **Q34: How do I get my API key?** **A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs. **Q35: What is a proxy?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-28?id=live-session-28-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs. **Q35: What is a proxy?** **A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI. **Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?** **A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage. **Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?** **A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient. **Q38: How are API calls made?** **A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output. **Q39: Can you share the notebook file?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-28?id=live-session-28-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output. **Q39: Can you share the notebook file?** **A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available. **Q40: What about function calling?** **A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate. **Q41: What about embeddings?** **A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session. **Q42: What about text extraction?** **A42:** We'll cover this in a future session. **Q43: What about Base64 encoding?** **A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API. **Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One.

The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request.

It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face. **Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-30?id=live-session-30-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

It would be too heavy for TDS. **Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?** **A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\". **Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?** **A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course. **Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.** **A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD?

The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle. **Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?** **A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them.

The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only. **Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?** **A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about `httpie`. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better.

We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function. **Q2: What is the first step in the process?** **A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request. **Q3: What is the goal of the program?** **A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders. **Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-01-31?id=live-session-31-jan-2025", "type": "course_content"}

OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format. **Q5: What are the predefined functions?** **A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt. **Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?** **A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set.

The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application. **Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?** **A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells. **Q9: How is the JSON response handled?** **A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function. **Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?** **A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information.

It's recommended to save your work frequently. **Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?** **A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters. **Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?** **A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation. **Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?** **A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments.

Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step. **Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-01?id=live-session-01-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors. **Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?** **A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-01?id=live-session-01-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function. **Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?** **A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin. **Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-01?id=live-session-01-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin. **Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?** **A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling. **Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?** **A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL. **Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?** **A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that: - The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function. - The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time). - The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity). - You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`). **Q9: How do I use Docker?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-01?id=live-session-01-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container. **Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?** **A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system.

Can you elaborate?** **A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process. **Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).** **A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming. **Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?** **A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas. **Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?** **A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks. **Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.** **A21:** That's okay.

These will be part of the request parameters. **Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?** **A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs. **Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?** **A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure. **Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?** **A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call. **Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?** **A26:** It can be any URL.

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones. **Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?** **A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel. **Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?** **A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube. **Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?** **A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale.

If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly. **Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?** **A6:** There are three ways: - **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly. - **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID. - **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data. **Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-06?id=live-session-06-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint. **Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?** **A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key. **Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?** **A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready.

The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States). **Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?** **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions.

The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values. **Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?** **A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method. **Q10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?** **A10:** Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages. **Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?**", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/live-session-2025-02-07?id=live-session-07-feb-2025", "type": "course_content"}

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: - **[Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/)**: Combines a vector index with a SQLite database. Easy to install, most popular. - **[LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/)**: Written in Rust. Faster, easy to install, growing popular. - **[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**: Meta's lightweight library", "source": "https://tds.s-anand.net/#/vector-databases?id=vector-databases", "type": "course_content"}

They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_.

For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!
